<p>The Episcopal Church in the United States is one of 38 provinces or national churches in the 
   worldwide Anglican Communion. Taking its name from the Latin word for bishop (episcopus), the 
   Episcopal Church numbers 2.3 million baptized members and has 7,300 congregations organized 
   in 100 domestic  (North America) dioceses and 13 dioceses in Latin America, the Caribbean 
   and in Europe.  Its faith and order is patterned after the Church of England which incorporates 
   both Protestant and Catholic practices and principles. This heritage allows the Episcopal Church 
   and its sister Anglican churches to serve as a middle way, or via media, between the two poles 
   of Christian tradition.</p>
<br>
<strong>HISTORY</strong>
<p>The Episcopal Church was formally organized in 1783 when representatives of the Church of England 
   in the United States of America met in Maryland and organized the Protestant Episcopal Church in 
   the United States. A year later Samuel Seabury traveled to Scotland be ordained the first Episcopal 
   bishop by three Church of Scotland bishops. In 1785 the church's first General Convention, consisting 
   of a House of Deputies, met in Philadelphia. The General Convention became a bicameral body in 1789 
   when the House of Bishops was formed. The first American Book of Common Prayer, modeled on the 
   Church of England prayer book, was adopted by General Convention in 1790. The church's corporate 
   organization, The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, was founded in 1820.</p> 

<p>Bishop William White of Pennsylvania was the church's first presiding bishop. Until 1919 the 
   presiding bishop's office was held by the church's most senior bishop. The first bishop to be 
   elected presiding bishop was John Gardner Murray, bishop of Maryland, who served from 1926 to 1931. 
   In 1946 the General Convention designated the presiding bishop as the chief pastor and primate of 
   the church, and removed the requirement that the presiding bishop also function as a diocesan 
   bishop. In 1994 the presiding bishop's term of office was reduced from twelve years to nine years. 
   The presiding bishop and staff work out of the Episcopal Church Center, 815 Second Avenue, New 
   York, NY 10017.</p>

<strong>THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION</strong>
<p>The Episcopal Church is one of 38 self-governing churches or provinces in the world-wide Anglican 
	Communion. Located in 160 countries on five continents, the churches are linked by their 
	proclamation of the catholic and apostolic faith; their grounding in scripture, tradition and 
	reason; their common liturgical tradition derived from The Book of Common Prayer; their recognition
	of the Eucharist as the central act of worship; and through their historic ties to the Archbishop 
	of Canterbury, primate of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the 70-million member 
	communion. The present Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. and Rt. Hon. Rowan Williams, was 
	nominated archbishop by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2002 and enthroned in February 2003.</p>

<strong>DIOCESES</strong>
<p>The basic unit of organization in the Episcopal Church is the diocese, a geographic group of at least 
   six parishes under the leadership of a bishop. The Episcopal Church comprises 100 domestic dioceses 
   and 13 overseas dioceses, most of which are in Central and South America. Massachusetts is the 
   largest with over 91,000 members, while the smallest, in the United States, is Eau Claire (Wis.) 
   numbering just over 2,500. The total number of congregations stands at 7,305, while the church's 
   total membership numbers 2.3 million.</p>

<strong>CLERGY</strong>
<p>The Episcopal Church recognizes three orders of ordained ministers: bishops, priests, and deacons. 
   There are 162 active bishops in the church, serving as diocesan, coadjutor, assistant and suffragan 
   bishops, and over 150 retired bishops. There are around 14,000 priests and 1,700 deacons.</p>

<strong>GENERAL CONVENTION</strong>
<p>The General Convention is believed to be the largest bicameral legislative body in the world, 
   numbering over 900 deputies and 300 bishops. It meets every three years to approve the church's 
   program and budget; address resolutions and legislation affecting the church's faith and order, and 
   its position on issues before the church and wider society; and, if necessary, elect a presiding 
   bishop. The House of Deputies meets only during General Convention, while the House of Bishops meets 
   twice a year, though it cannot enact legislation during these interim meetings.</p> 

<p>The House of Deputies consists of four lay and four clerical deputies from each diocese of the 
   church. All bishops, active and retired, make up the House of Bishops. Other Anglican bishops can be 
   admitted to non-voting membership in the House of Bishops. Legislation and resolutions can be 
   introduced in either house, but both houses must concur for the measures to take effect. The General 
   Convention next meets in Denver in July 2000.</p>

<strong>PRESIDING BISHOP</strong>
<p>The presiding bishop serves as the chief pastor and primate of the church, president of the House of 
   Bishops, president of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, and president and chair of the 
   Executive Council. The House of Bishops elects the presiding bishop, whose election must then be 
   confirmed by the House of Deputies. Presiding bishop's duties include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initiating and developing the policy and strategy of the church</li>
	<li>Representing the church and the episcopate to the world</li>
	<li>Providing episcopal ministry in dioceses without bishops</li>
	<li>Convening meetings of bishops</li>
	<li>Serving as chief consecrator at ordinations of bishops</li>
	<li>Visiting all dioceses of the church</li>
	<li>Reporting annually to the church through the General Convention</li>
</ul>

<p>The presiding bishop is assisted by a staff of over 200 at the Episcopal Church Center, 815 Second 
   Ave., New York City. The church also operates field offices in Washington, DC, (Governmental 
   Relations Office, Jubilee Ministries), Oklahoma City (Multicultural Ministries), Richmond, 
   Va. (Office of Pastoral Development), Chapel Hill, N.C. (General Board of Examining Chaplains),
   and Paris (American Convocation of Churches in Europe).</p>
