<p>Forward Movement Publications is rushing to press a special edition of the devotional Forward Day by Day entitled Meditations for a Time of Crisis. This resource is being offered to help people deal prayerfully with the horrible tragedy at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in rural Pennsylvania. It will include thirty meditations. One million copies will be printed and distributed both freely and widely within and beyond the Episcopal Church. (Current subscribers to Day by Day -individuals and congregations - will automatically receive a copy.)</p>
<p>To obtain copies, contact the Office of Communications at (312) 751-4207 or call Forward Movement Publications at (800) 543-1813. They will be shipped as soon as possible.</p>
