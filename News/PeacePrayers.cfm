<p>Oh God, we stand before you with so many fears and uncertainties--imagined and real.  Come to us and all people who seek your way.  Bring into your peace the chaos that is war and use us as your sons and daughters to show and live the way of peace and love.  For we take our stand on your promise that love is stronger than hate, kindness greater than revenge.  Turn our hearts, ever convert us to this truth and make us more whole as your Body in the world.  Through your child, Jesus, who overcame violence and death with love and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit now and for eternity.        AMEN - (The Rev. Scott Allen, Bethlehem, PA, EPF National Executive Council member)</p>

Lead me from death to life, from falsehood to truth; Lead me from despair to hope, from fear to trust;<br>
Lead me from hate to love, from war to peace. Let peace fill our heart, our world, our universe.<br><br>

O God of many names, lover of all places; we pray for peace in our hearts and homes.  In our nations and our world; the peace of your will, the peace of our need.<br>
O God of peace and justice, of holiness and love; knit us together in mind and flesh in feeling and in spirit, and make us one, ready for that great day; the fulfillment of all our hopes and the glory of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

For the hungry and the overfed - May we have enough.<br>
For the mourners and the mockers - May we laugh together.<br>
For the victims and the oppressors - May we share power wisely.<br>
For the peacemakers and the warmongers - May clear truth and stern love lead us to harmony.<br>
For the silenced and the propagandists - May we speak our own words in truth. <br>
For the unemployed and the overworked - May our impress on the earth be kindly and creative.<br>
For the troubled and the sleek - May we live together as  wounded healers.<br>
For the homeless and the cosseted - May our homes be simple, warm and welcoming.<br>
For the vibrant and the dying - May we all die to live. <br><br>

<br><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="navy">Prayers from the Muslim Tradition:</font><br>Muslim Peace Fellowship: <a href="http://www.mpfweb.org">www.mpfweb.org</a><br>

<p>O you who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity, and let not hatred of any people seduce you, that you deal not justly. Deal justly, that is nearer to reverence. Show reverence toward Allah: Allah is Aware of what ye do. (Surah Ma'idah, 8)</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated that Allah Exalted and Glorious, said: My servants, I have made oppression unlawful for Me and unlawful for you, so do not commit oppression against one another. (Muslim 6246; from Abu Dharr)</p>


<br><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="navy">Prayers from the New Union Prayer Book</font><br>Central Conference of American Rabbi's<br>

<p>O God, You have called us to peace, for You are Peace itself.  May we have the vision to see that each of us, in some measure, can help to realize these aims:</p>
Where there are ignorance and superstition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be enlightenment and knowledge.<br>
Where there are prejudice and hatred,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be acceptance and love.<br>
Where there are fear and suspicion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be confidence and trust.<br>
Where threre are tyranny and oppression,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be freedom and justice.<br>
Where there are poverty and disease,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be  prosperity and health.<br>
Where there are strife and discord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be harmony and peace.<br>
