<p>This form of the Prayers of the People is designed to contrast God's creative action with our (sometimes helpful and sometimes hurtful) anxious business. The prayers invoke the calmness of spirit which comes from working in accord with God's creative will.</p>
<p>This form is presented with parts for a lay leader, the deacon, and the presider. In communities where there is no deacon, the lay leader can read the deacon's part.</p>
<p>This form may be used as is or adapted to meet the needs of the local community.</p>
