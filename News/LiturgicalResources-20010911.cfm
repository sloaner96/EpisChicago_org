<p>O God, we call out to you in our fear, our rage and our confusion as cities burn and the innocent suffer and die.   Hold us fast more and more in your love.   Increase in us the mind and spirit of Christ, so that through us as your disciples, evil can be confronted by good, violence met with care, hatred overwhelmed with love; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord.  <I>Amen.</I></p>
