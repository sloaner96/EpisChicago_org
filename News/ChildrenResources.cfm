<p><I><FONT SIZE=-1>From the Children's Defense Fund</I></FONT></p>

<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">
<p>Our hopes and prayers are with all of our colleagues in New York City, Washington D.C., and across the country.  In light of yesterday's sad events, we thought we would provide you with some resources for talking with children about the tragedy.  These are general resources that can be used by parents, teachers, and other caregivers to help children through these difficult days.</p>

Some general advice from the experts includes:
<ol>
<li>Continuously reassure your children that you will help to keep them safe.

<li>Turn off the TV.  Overexposure to the media can be traumatizing.  If your older children are watching the news, be sure to watch with them.

<li>Be aware that your child's age will affect his or her response.  Adolescents in particular may be hard hit by these kinds of events.  Obtaining counseling for a child or adolescent soon after a disaster may reduce long-term effects.

<li>Calmly express your emotions, but remember that a composed demeanor will provide a greater sense of security for your child.

<li>Give your children extra time and attention and plan to spend more time with your children in the following months.

<li>Let your children ask questions, talk about what happened, and express their feelings.

<li>Play with children who can't talk yet to help them work out their fears and respond to the atmosphere around them.

<li>Keep regular schedules for activities such as eating, playing and going to bed to help restore a sense of security and normalcy.

<li>Consider how you and your child can help.  Children are better able to regain their sense of power and security if they feel they can help in some way.
