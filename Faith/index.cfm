<p>Episcopalians are first and foremost Christians. We believe God has created us, and that "God don't make no junk!" We proclaim and follow Jesus as Lord. We believe God is alive and well and active in our day to day lives through the power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Episcopalians are also part of The Episcopal Church, U.S.A. under the pastoral leadership of our Presiding Bishop, The Most Reverend Frank Griswald. Every local parish is part of a Diocese, and there are currently 100 dioceses in the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>The Episcopal Church is but one of the autonomous sister Churches of the Anglican Communion -- a fellowship of Churches all in communion with The Church of England. The Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Reverend George Carey, is our spiritual leader and symbol of our unity.</p>
<p>All Anglican Churches are drawn together by a common loyalty to:</p>

<ul>
<li>scripture as the revealed Word of God 
<li>the historical Creeds of the Church as sufficient statements of Christian belief 
<li>the celebration of the seven sacraments of the Church with special emphasis on Baptism and Eucharist 
<li>the apostolic ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons in the life of teaching and service in the Church 
<li>the use of scripture, Church tradition, and reason in matters of belief and practice
</ul>

<p>Episcopalians believe that the most important thing we do as Christians is to gather together for worship. We are "busy" worshipers. Episcopal worship may seem confusing at first, but it is a form and a style of worship that is both centuries old and yet so dynamic as to keep us from becoming stale and bored. </p>
<p>Episcopalians sit, kneel, stand, sing, pray aloud, pray silently. Some of us bow and make the sign of the cross; others of us don't. We regularly perform the "Episcopal juggle" by balancing the Book of Common Prayer, The Hymnal and (in many places) a service bulletin. These tools are all designed to help us worship and pray together, something that is very important to Anglican Christians.</p>
<p>Episcopal worship calls for the full participation of all the people, and the Prayer Book will usually guide you in what comes next, what to do, and what to say or sing. These guides are often printed in italics. Our people are genuinely thoughtful and friendly. Should you find yourself a little lost or bewildered during the service, please feel free to ask someone near you for guidance. </p>
<p>The main form of worship in the Episcopal Church is the Holy Eucharist, also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the Mass. If you have been baptized in any Christian tradition with water in the name of the Trinity (no matter your age), then we invite and encourage you to join us at the Altar rail for communion. When the time comes, just go to the communion rail with the others around you, kneel or stand as you prefer, and place your right hand over your left to receive the consecrated bread. People are also invited to receive the wine in our services and may always receive from a common cup called a chalice. Some prefer to dip the bread into the wine. How this is done is determined by each diocesan bishop, and most places will print instructions in the service bulletin.</p>
<p>If you have not been baptized, please know you are most welcome to join us at the Altar rail for a blessing. Simply cross your arms in front of your chest and the priest will offer you God's blessing.</p>
<p>Whether you are worshiping in Boston or San Francisco, or anywhere on God's earth, we hope and pray you will go into the world refreshed, encouraged, challenged, accepted and filled with the peace of God which passes all understanding. </p>
