<B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P>HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>The Episcopal Church was formally organized in 1783 when representatives of the Church of England in the United States of America met in Maryland and organized the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. A year later Samuel Seabury traveled to Scotland be ordained the first Episcopal bishop by three Church of Scotland bishops. In 1785 the church's first General Convention, consisting of a House of Deputies, met in Philadelphia. The General Convention became a bicameral body in 1789 when the House of Bishops was formed. The first American Book of Common Prayer, modeled on the Church of England prayer book, was adopted by General Convention in 1790. The church's corporate organization, The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, was founded in 1820. </P>
<P>Bishop William White of Pennsylvania was the church's first presiding bishop. Until 1919 the presiding bishop's office was held by the church's most senior bishop. The first bishop to be elected presiding bishop was John Gardner Murray, bishop of Maryland, who served from 1926 to 1931. In 1946 the General Convention designated the presiding bishop as the chief pastor and primate of the church, and removed the requirement that the presiding bishop also function as a diocesan bishop. In 1994 the presiding bishop's term of office was reduced from twelve years to nine years.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P>THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>The Episcopal Church is one of 38 self-governing churches or provinces in the world-wide Anglican Communion. Located in 160 countries on five continents, the churches are linked by their proclamation of the catholic and apostolic faith; their grounding in scripture, tradition and reason; their common liturgical tradition derived from The Book of Common Prayer; their recognition of the Eucharist as the central act of worship; and through their historic ties to the Archbishop of Canterbury, primate of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the 70-million member communion. The present Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. and Rt. Hon. George L. Carey, was appointed archbishop by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua">
<P>DIOCESES</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>The basic unit of organization in the Episcopal Church is the diocese, a geographic group of at least six parishes under the leadership of a bishop. The Episcopal Church comprises 100 domestic dioceses and 13 overseas dioceses, most of which are in Central and South America. Massachusetts is the largest with over 91,000 members, while the smallest, in the United States, is Eau Claire (Wis.) numbering just over 2,500. The total number of congregations stands at 7,400, while the church's total membership numbers 2.4 million. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P>CLERGY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>The Episcopal Church recognizes three orders of ordained ministers: bishops, priests, and deacons. There are 162 active bishops in the church, serving as diocesan, coadjutor, assistant and suffragan bishops, and over 150 retired bishops. There are around 14,000 priests and 1,700 deacons.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P>GENERAL CONVENTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>The General Convention is believed to be the largest bicameral legislative body in the world, numbering over 900 deputies and 300 bishops. It meets every three years to approve the church's program and budget; address resolutions and legislation affecting the church's faith and order, and its position on issues before the church and wider society; and, if necessary, elect a presiding bishop. The House of Deputies meets only during General Convention, while the House of Bishops meets twice a year, though it cannot enact legislation during these interim meetings. </P>
<P>The House of Deputies consists of four lay and four clerical deputies from each diocese of the church. All bishops, active and retired, make up the House of Bishops. Other Anglican bishops can be admitted to non-voting membership in the House of Bishops. Legislation and resolutions can be introduced in either house, but both houses must concur for the measures to take effect. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P>PRESIDING BISHOP</P></B></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=2><P>Serves as the chief pastor and primate of the church, president of the House of Bishops, president of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, and president and chair of the Executive Council. The House of Bishops elects the presiding bishop, whose election must then be confirmed by the House of Deputies. Presiding bishop's duties include:</P>
