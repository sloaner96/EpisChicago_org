<P>The Anglican Communion is made up of 33 self-governing churches or provinces in 160 nations on every continent of the world. In addition there are four churches (Portugal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Bermuda), and the Diocese of Europe, under the Archbishop of Canterbury's direct oversight; the Convocation of American Churches in Europe which is under the oversight of the Episcopal Church USA's (ECUSA) presiding bishop; the Episcopal Church of Cuba which is overseen by a Metropolitan Council (the Canadian, ECUSA and West Indies primates);  and four united churches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh which are also members of the Communion. In North America, the Communion is represented by the 2.5 million member Episcopal Church and the 850,000 member Anglican Church of Canada. Baptized members of the Communion number over 70 million.</P>

<P>The churches are linked by their proclamation of the Catholic and Apostolic faith; their theological grounding in scripture, tradition and reason; their sharing of a common liturgy derived from <I>The Book of Common Prayer; </I>their recognition of the Eucharist as the central act of worship; and through their ties to the Archbishop of Canterbury who serves as the primate of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the Communion.</P>

<P>In addition to serving as president of the Church of England's General Synod-a position shared with the Archbishop of York-the Archbishop of Canterbury convenes the decennial Lambeth Conference, chairs the biennial Primates Meeting, and presides at meetings of the Anglican Consultative Council. His most visible role is as ambassador and spokesman for the Communion to governments and international agencies, and as the Communion's representative to ecumenical and interfaith councils. The office of the Archbishop dates to 597 when the first Archbishop of Canterbury, St. Augustine, was consecrated. In April 1991, the Most Rev. and Rt. Hon. George L. Carey was enthroned as the 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury.</P>

<P>The unity and identity of the Communion is maintained through several institutions and periodic gatherings:</P>

<B><FONT size="+1" COLOR="#000080"><P>The Lambeth Conference</FONT></B> is a gathering of bishops meeting every ten years under the presidency of the Archbishop of Canterbury. These meetings, which draw over 800 bishops, adopt advisory reports and resolutions to guide the faith, work and order of national churches and provinces. The first conference was held in 1867 at Lambeth Palace in London-the residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury-and the next takes place this summer from July 18 through August 9 at the University of Kent in Canterbury. Four themes will guide the 1998 conference: <I>Called to Full Humanity, Called to Live and Proclaim the Good News, Called to be Faithful in a Plural World, </I>and <I>Called to be One.</i></P>

<P>The first conference was called to settle a theological dispute between two South African bishops-the bishop of Capetown and the suffragan bishop of Natal-over the authority of Scripture (the bishop of Natal had been deposed by the bishop of Capetown for publicly questioning the truth of the Old Testament). Subsequent Lambeths have addressed missionary work (1878), the essential principles of Anglican faith (1888), prayer book revision (1908), church unity (1920), birth control (1958), the ordination of women (1978), and women in the episcopate and interfaith relations (1988). </P>

<B><FONT size="+1" COLOR="#000080"><P>The Primates Meeting. </FONT></B>  Senior archbishops or presiding bishops of the 36 autonomous churches or provinces have been meeting every two or three years since 1979 for consultations on theological, social and international issues. The last meeting took place in Jerusalem in 1997.</P>

<B><FONT size="+1" COLOR="#000080"><P>The Anglican Consultative Council</FONT></B> is a 69-member international assembly of the Anglican Communion, bringing together bishops, presbyters, deacons, lay adults and youth to work on common concerns. It was established in 1968 and functions as an advisory body with the Archbishop of Canterbury serving as president. It meets every two years at different sites within the Communion. Its responsibilities are to promote information and resource sharing between provinces, promote collaboration between Anglican churches and other Christian churches, assist in ecumenical conferences and dialogues, and develop policies on world mission and the Communion's structure. Representation is based on church membership: churches with over one million members are entitled to three representatives, those with over 250,000 are allowed two representatives, and those under 250,000 are allowed one representative. Its most recent meeting took place in Cape Town, South Africa in January 1993.</P>

<B><FONT size="+1" COLOR="#000080"><P>The Anglican Communion Secretariat</FONT></B> was established with the formation of the Anglican Consultative Council in 1968, and is intended to support communications between churches and provinces. Its international staff, under the direction of the general secretary, is supported by an inter-Anglican budget which is funded by contributions from the member churches. The Rev. Canon John L. Peterson, former dean of St. George's College, Jerusalem, is the current secretary general.</P>
