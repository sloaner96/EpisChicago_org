<h3>"The Melody of God’s Mission"</h3>

<P>I am delighted and honoured here in the lovely church of St. Chrysostom’s, Chicago, to give the very first Gilchrist lecture – established by Peter Wilmott, in honour of the memory and achievements of the Rev Charles Gilchrist, who died last year. Charles was a distinguished man and devout Episcopalian who sought to relate his faith to life. He was an elected member of the House of Representatives for some years, but he shocked many of his friends and colleagues by forsaking politics in 1986 in order to enter seminary. As one close friend remarked at the time of his death, Gilchrist’s &quot;character shined even more brightly than his considerable accomplishments.&quot;  For five years Charles served as executive director of the Cathedral Shelter in this great city.  I think I speak for us all in saying how grateful we are to Peter Wilmott for establishing this Gilchrist Fund for Outreach and Mission in Charlie’s memory.</P>

<P>From the little I know of Charles Gilchrist, it is obvious that his passion was to bring the worlds of Church and community together. For him, a faith that did not engage with life’s problems was counterfeit, and Church life that began and ended at the church door was simply playing at being Church. I have no doubt that Charles would have overjoyed at a lectureship set up to explore the implications of mission today.</P>

<P>The title of this first lecture, therefore, is entirely in keeping with his life’s work and it is:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Melody of God’s Mission</P>
</B>
<P>Let me commence then with two different but true stories from the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Charles Ives is well known as a brilliant composer from Danbury, in Connecticut, who only found true fame and respectability long after he ceased composing. The greatest influence on Ives’ life was his father George, who introduced his son to concepts of polytonality and multiple metres. Apparently, his father used to experiment with bands marching up and down Danbury’s Main Street, simultaneously playing marches in different keys and metres. The experiments were, we are told, not entirely successful – even though they must have enormous fun to most if not all listeners. And, we can say with some certainty, they must have been definitely memorable! </P>

<P>Charles then developed his father’s work in polytonality to show how different musical styles could coexist. But, more than that, he took his father’s ideas further still – even if he did not go to the same lengths to prove different melodies could deepen and enrich music!</P>

<P>My second illustration comes from the life of the former Bishop of Winchester, Bishop John Taylor, a distinguished theologian and former missionary. John is now well in his 80’s, but when he was a diocesan bishop his gardener, Tom, asked him if he would baptise their first child. He replied that, of course, nothing would give him greater joy. And Tom and his young wife were thrilled. Their entire family turned up and the baptism turned out to be a wonderful event.  True: the family were not great church-goers, but they were devout in their own way and so happy to be together for such a great event. </P>

<P>The problems began as they left the country church. The Bishop and his wife walked away and Mrs Taylor asked: &quot;Are we not joining the family for tea?&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; said John, &quot;I don’t know. No one said anything about that. No. Let them enjoy themselves – we’ll go home.&quot;</P>

<P>The next day Tom appeared at the Bishop’s study and with a concerned look on his face said, &quot;Bishop, did we upset you yesterday? Did we do something wrong? I know we are not used to these things, but we did feel so sad that you did not join us for tea. We wanted you there to share in our joy – but you did not come.&quot;</P>

<P>The Bishop told me that it seemed so lame to say that he had been waiting for an invitation. It was obvious that he was expected – and in his own words he said, &quot;I failed to hear the liturgy of life. I was so keen to hear my own liturgy, the Church’s melody, that I did not hear another song being sung that afternoon.&quot;</P>

<P>Listening is not the easiest thing for modern people to do. We are deafened by so much noise from the world around us, and Church life, too, can be full of so many things that the small, still voice of alternative melodies are too indistinct for us to hear. We have to pay attention and then we might be able to make out different celebrations and different liturgies going on.</P>

<P>But what is the character of God’s music? I note with fascination that the last book of the Bible, <I>The Revelation of St John</I>, quite simply takes it for granted that there will be music and singing in heaven. The saints of God seem to launch into song as soon as the mighty works of God are mentioned: &quot;Amen! Glory and blessing and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be to our God for ever and ever.&quot; </P>
<P>Perhaps that is what John Donne, the 17<SUP>th</SUP>-century Dean of St Paul’s, was alluding to in his wonderful poem:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And into that gate they shall enter.<br>
And in that house they shall dwell,<br>
Where there shall be no cloud nor sun,<br>
No darkness nor dazzling but one equal light,<br>
No voice nor silence, but one equal music,<br>
No fears nor hopes, but one equal possession,<br>
No foes nor friends but one equal communion and identity,<br>
No ends nor beginnings but one equal eternity</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Yes, indeed. The Church has reason for singing because we have good news, indeed, the very best of news – that Christ is God’s answer to our needs, our questions, our longings for meaning and hope.</P>

<P>However, as we have seen, Christian people are sometimes so obsessed by their own melody of life that they ignore the possibility that others are dancing to a different tune and singing another liturgy. And their melody is not second-best. Often it celebrates all that God has given us in Creation.  It is about joy and laughter and fun; it is about family happiness and individual fulfilment. It is about employment and riches and enjoying the bounty of the world. Later, as we go home after this lecture, we shall see people sitting in restaurants simply enjoying life. It is the liturgy of human happiness and it must not be decried.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>Why is it that the Church in first-world countries has such difficulty connecting with the joyful song of the world around? Perhaps one of the reasons is to do with the reality that our world is oppressed, in the main, not by lack, but by surfeit; not by strife, but by ease.  Of course there are pockets of poverty among us, but on the whole most people have benefited enormously from the rises in real incomes over the past few decades. Speaking as a European – but I guess this comment would be echoed by Americans of my generation also – there are not many who can remember the last World War when we were literally at rock bottom.<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </B></FONT>And we have paid a price for such comfort and ease. We are in a situation where the things of ultimate importance are invisible, obscured by the things of transitory glamour.  The &quot;love that moves the sun and other stars,&quot; to quote the final words of Dante’s <I>Divine Comedy</I>, cannot easily endure in such a culture.  The Church says that now, and part of its mission will be to keep on saying it.</P>

<P>But if modern abundance and human joy are not to be denied or decried, they do present the Church with a challenge to its mission. And it is this: What is the message of the Church to those who are strong? To those without apparent need? To those who, in the words of Karl Rahner, are &quot;unmusical in religion&quot;?</P>

<P>And the problem then is that, when we engage in mission and proclaim our faith to our world, we appear to end up with a mission that is a pale shadow of what the New Testament meant by it. If all are heard to say is: &quot;Yes, it’s obvious you lead a wonderful life, with your two lovely children, your luxurious home and private swimming pool, your two vacations a year, your two cars, two televisions, two VCR’s, two microwaves, two Jacuzzis…but – you also need God in your life.  That’s all that’s missing.&quot;  </P>

<P>But that is <I>not</I> the Gospel. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Yet, too often we make out that that is the case: that people are substantially &quot;all right&quot; – and that they just need to come to know Jesus as well. That, as we have to admit, is all a little too cosy and cheap. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer reminded the Church of his day, cheap grace sells the Gospel short.  It is merely an ‘add on’ faith. </P>

<P>How, then, do we get inside the modern human condition? How does the Gospel engage intellectually with modern, thinking people? Emmanuel Kant described the three major questions confronting every thinking person as: &quot;What can we know? What ought we to do? What can we hope for?&quot;</P>

<P>And these questions about 'meaning', about 'morality' and about 'destiny' are fundamental to us all. But they can't be reduced to the mantra: &quot;Come along to church and all will be explained.&quot; Authentic Christianity surely includes church-going, but it is far richer than this. It is a way of life. Authentic Christianity is the joyful adventure of entering into the mission of God. It is the risk-filled challenge to take up our cross and follow Christ. It is a liturgy that still fills the hearts of many with song and celebration.</P>

<P>So, to use Charles Ives’s technique, how may the melodies connect? How may our liturgy be a song that others can also sing?</P>

<P>A clue is offered to us in the word ‘liturgy’. It actually means ‘service’. The Greek word ‘<I>leitourgos</I>’ means far more than what we do in Church. Paul uses it of his action in giving money to the poor of Jerusalem. He uses it also of the love and care shown to him by Epaphroditus, one of his friends. In later Greek, the word ‘<I>leitourgos</I>’ simply came to mean a ‘workman’. But its use also in worship allows us to see it as word that brings together the two worlds of worship and service – a thing that Charles Gilchrist also loved to see. I remember hearing the story of the young man who rushed into a church at the end of the liturgy. &quot;Is the service over?&quot; he gasped. The churchwarden corrected him: &quot;Our worship is over, young man,&quot; he said, &quot;but our service is about to begin.&quot;</P>

<P>Let us tonight listen first to the liturgy of the universal Church. Our Church, the Anglican Communion, consisting of 37 interdependent Provinces, is not one of the largest Churches in the world. Indeed, with our 70+ million members, we are quite small. But we are significant in being one of the few world communions with a structure that binds us all together. So, unlike a lot of Churches, there is a similarity in belief and doctrine, liturgy and faith, lifestyle and mission, which makes us one. During my nine years as Archbishop of Canterbury, Eileen and I have grown to love the Communion and we have been enriched by our contact with her. We are a suffering Communion, with brothers and sisters who are caught up in the agony of conflict, war and persecution. Still to this day I can picture the Sudanese young woman with two babies crying across to me in a huge refugee camp outside Khartoum: &quot;Please help me to return home!&quot; And yet, Sudan and Africa keep singing. Indeed, an African said to me once &quot;When Africa stops singing, that will be the end.&quot; Sudanese Christianity – and in particular the Episcopal Church of Sudan – is strong and growing. They are still singing wonderful songs of renewal with their Dinka crosses held high and the blue and white of the wonderful Mothers’ Union central to it. </P>

<P>But oh, the poverty and the sadness of places like Africa. Again, I think of the children’s home in Durban where 30 young children, all under the age of 4, are infected with HIV/Aids, and where all will be dead before they reach four. I cannot adequately describe the feeling of anger I felt when I learned that the greatest distress the devoted staff felt was when one of their babies passed away. So poor is the home that they could not afford the pay for a simple ceremony and a burial – they had to ask the police to come and cremate the tiny remains. I am grateful that, within an hour of hearing this, I was able to make arrangements with the local bishop to set up proper arrangements for loving Christian burial. </P>

<P>But these are just two examples of the many sufferings of our brothers and sisters who have absolutely nothing in this world in terms of goods, but whose liturgy is a ceaseless expression of joy and faith in our Lord. You cannot but go to any part of Africa, in spite of the suffering and pain, without returning more deeply committed to the Communion. I had no answer to the simple message of one of our Sudanese bishops who said to me: &quot;Archbishop, it is so difficult for us to go into the refugee camps and speak of God’s love, because we, too, are poor and have nothing to share with them.&quot; We have a proverb: &quot;Empty stomachs have no ears.&quot; Empty stomachs have no ears.</P>

<P>But I don’t want to suggest that we are doing nothing. Let me tell you of a few current initiatives.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Your Presiding Bishop has his own Episcopal Relief and Development Fund, which helps many different parts of the Communion. I commend it – it is doing a great work everywhere.</LI>

<LI>I have established a Fund to help respond to critical situations where resources are needed <U>now</U>, and where people cannot wait for a committee to make a decision. It is a Fund that is in urgent need of replenishing. </LI>

<LI>I am currently helping a number of orphans of deceased bishops who are destitute and who have no one else to care for them. </LI>

<LI>Several years ago, I established the Anglican Investment Agency. It is an ingenious way of raising money that benefits both investor and the poor of the Anglican Communion. Sir John Templeton and John Beck, great Christians and successful investors, have invited us to use their financial services free of charge, so that the commission they make goes directly to the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Anglican Communion Fund. We have $30 million invested to date but desperately need to raise this figure far higher. It is my dream that all endowed Churches might invest a little of their funds in this ingenious agency, knowing that their money is wholly secure and that it is the commission from investments that goes directly to the very needy and poor.</LI>

<LI>I am encouraging links between dioceses in richer countries and those in the poorer parts – through the actual experience of sharing, a deeper commitment to the Communion will grow. </LI></OL>


<P>But let me now move away from the Communion and its mission and invite you to listen to the liturgy of the world in which we live and ask: &quot;What elements of this song can we sing and how discordant is it with the Christian liturgy?&quot;</P>

<P>Any Christian reflection on Creation must begin with God and his great love of his world. What he loves we should never despise. He is the creator of its beauty and therefore of its most melodious song. He is in perpetual mission towards the world and us. The Holy Spirit who brooded over the primordial waters is still the ever-revealing, ever-missionising God.</P>

<P>But not everything in the garden is rosy and as it ought to be. The mission of the Church includes raising its voice when errors are made; when evil things are done in the name of humanity or prosperity and progress. She must equally speak up for others when the rich harmonies of life seem to deny others a voice. </P>

<P>I love coming to the United States. It is a generous country, and many people around the world owe America a great deal. Today the US is the main engine for much of the world’s prosperity. Americans will do more than most to shape the future. More and more of us are learning American habits – often for the good, sometimes less beneficially. Both here and in many developed countries, it can be hard to hear here the music of the rest of the world. Our news and sport, our concerns and priorities, can become so self-centred as a culture that we risk growing deaf to what is happening elsewhere – unless there is a crisis, an earthquake or an extreme event which simply cannot be ignored.</P>

<P>Sometimes the price we pay for success is that we ignore those who do not succeed. It is vital, therefore, that the Church – both in this land and in other wealthy countries – hears the cries of the poor and seeks to stand with them.</P>

<P>And what insights should inform our representation of them?</P>

<P>Many years ago in a General Synod debate on evangelism, a former Archdeacon of Canterbury, Bernard Pawley, expressed a remarkable truth:</P>
<I>
</I><P>The long-suffering clergy do not wish to be told again and again to reinterpret the Gospel or make it relevant; they want help in doing it and want to hear what the Gospel sounds like and looks like when it has been so treated.  There is therefore here a poverty of inspiration which I find a little alarming.  It seems to me at this point the whole enterprise betrays its lack of inspiration and needs to be reoriented in one particular classical direction, that of prophecy. If you are going to indulge in evangelism, you have got to have prophets, who to my mind are singularly lacking.  If you want to do evangelism, first catch your prophet.</P>

<B><P>First, catch your prophet.</B> And the most fundamental thing I notice about the prophet is his passion for God’s holiness, for God’s justice, for God’s world and for God’s Church. To read any of the prophetic works of the Old Testament is to enter a world of intimacy with God who calls forth love, anger, indignation, and suffering. The message is holistic: there is no separation of holiness from social justice or of worship from compassion for the weak. Mission and evangelism hang together.</P>

<P>And what I believe Bernard Pawley was getting at was that the prophetic mission sprang from a passionate concern for issues of justice, goodness, and equality of opportunity. And I want to say that I am proud of our Communion’s great commitment to issues that have been and are prophetic. I think of Desmond Tutu’s remarkable leadership in South Africa, but his was not the only voice nor was he the only leader – it was the Church as a whole, black and white together, that made such a remarkable impact. Or again, I think of Bishop Dinis Singulane in Mozambique, who was an influential bridge-builder in that war-torn country – and who continues to be a peacemaker even now. I think of our contribution to education and medicine in the poorer countries – to say nothing of our work among women and children.</P>

<P>David Bosch, in many ways the founder of modern missiological thinking, says this: </P>

<P>It belongs to our missionary mandate to ask questions about the use of power in our societies, to unmask those that destroy life, to show concern for the victims of society while at the same time calling to repentance those who have turned them into victims, and to articulate God’s active wrath against all that distorts and diminishes human beings and all that exploits, squanders and disfigures the world.</P>

<P>This is a prophetic mission.  It is a mission we must perform, in the midst of our diseased societies, with a vision of how things might be.</P>

<P>And that mission continues, with our voices raised in such matters as the cancellation of world debt and the halving of world poverty by 2015. I welcome your President’s great idea of getting children in third world countries educated by promising them one good meal a day. What a brilliant and down to earth idea. We know that education is the key to progress, and to provide young children with their ‘daily bread’ would be to transform the lives of the absolutely poor.</P>

<P>You see, prophetic mission stems from the ability to hear the laments of the poor. When we hear them, we can make the poor visible and thus share in the mission of Christ to a needy world. </P>

<P>There is another song we must hear, and it is the song that comes to us from close at hand – the ‘liturgy of life’ from the place where we are situated and to whom our ministry is primarily directed. And there are so many songs being sung even at this very moment: the celebratory and noisy songs of the wealthy, the healthy, the fortunate, the glamorous, the famous and the popular. Less discernible are the litanies of the poor, the struggling, the abandoned, the very sick and those terminally ill. Both groups are in need – the strong and the weak – both in need to God’s love and to know Paul’s secret: &quot;I know what it is to have little and I know what it is to have plenty. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry. I can do all things through him who strengthens me&quot; (Phil.4.13).</P>

<P>And this means that we, too, must be self-critical. If we are to throw a few stones, we must be wary that our house isn’t made of glass.  We may criticise our culture for being self-interested, but so often we are seen as wanting to hang on to what we have, like the wealthy young man who turned away from Jesus with a heavy heart, caught between the hunger to serve God and the cost such service entails.  The ‘maintenance <I>v.</I> mission’ debate is old hat now, of course, and we realise that we must strike a balance between the two duties.  We realise that part of maintenance is presence, and that presence is part of mission.  But we must guard constantly against complacency – and self-preservation – and we must be prepared to sacrifice the old and the comfortable in order to advance the Gospel.  That, indeed, is a long-established duty of Christians. </P>

<P>So then, what can we do? How may we be once again relevant to our culture and society?</P>

<P>And the only authentic answer we can give is by being ‘incarnational’. The example of this, of course, is Christ himself. He did not withdraw from life; he lived fully within it and thereby scandalised the religious and the secular establishments of his day. His mission was a seamless robe of ‘mission’ and ‘evangelism’. Social care rubbed shoulders naturally with Christ’s call for people to follow him; his anger at hypocrisy was all of a piece with his compassion for lepers and the very poor. His teaching about the Kingdom was in tune with his condemnation of social evil. Indeed, that should be our focus: not the Church, but the Kingdom of God – which, declared Jorgen Moltmann, &quot;isn’t there for the sake of the Church.  The Church is there for the sake of the Kingdom.&quot;  We must never forget it.  The Church’s mandate from our Lord is to proclaim the Gospel of God’s Kingdom to all human beings. In this way, evangelisation and prophetic mission complement and enrich each other. Consequently, the health of our Churches must be assessed according to the degree to which they look away from their own interests, focussing instead on God’s concerns and those of the world around.</P>

<P>Among my pantheon of Christian saints, heroes, and exemplars is W. L. Moody, whose ministry in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century was based here in Chicago. Moody was an almost illiterate young man whose life was overturned by God – and he, in turn, was greatly used by God to shake the lives of so many people on both sides of the Atlantic. The fascinating thing about Moody’s ministry was that it began with his great concern for young children, especially for those living in poverty and outside the reach of conventional Christianity of his day. Moody’s desire for these children to know Christ’s love meant that he had to provide education and other practical ways of showing God’s love. Although he became a great evangelist and founder of Churches, Moody never lost a broad vision of God’s love that must affect the whole of life.</P>

<P>And, that has also been at the heart of the way Anglicans have viewed mission. We have sought to incarnate and earth our ministry where we have lived. Think of the parish ministry and its structures. Consider those parishes – and they are more numerous that some are prepared to admit – where the daily round of worship, service, study, and pastoral care is all about mission. The late and great Peter Green of Salford has much to teach us. He once said: &quot;My object is first of all to gather a congregation, large, converted, instructed and missionary-hearted and then to set it to work. First, forge, temper and sharpen your sword; and then wield it.&quot;  And there are still many parishes doing just that, all around the world.</P>

<P>But lest I be accused of portraying an idealist picture and not relating it to real life, let me say something of what has been happening in my own Diocese of Canterbury as we have sought to be more mission-focused.</P>

<P>In 1995, the Bishop of Maidstone described to the Diocesan Synod some of the factors that are important for churches to grow. He produced this from a careful study of sixteen parishes that were growing. The churches were different in churchmanship and social background, and they included rural and urban parishes.  He noted six things:</P>

<OL>

<LI>In each case, the <B>leadership</B> of the church longed for growth to happen. The clergy and lay leaders shared a common desire to be at the heart of community and to share the Christian faith with others. I have seen again and again that leadership is the key factor in the growth of Church life.</LI>

<LI>Each church was eager to <B>build bridges into the community</B>. And in each of the 16 parishes, one or two aspects of Church life immediately related to the surrounding community. In several of the churches, it was children and young peoples’ work. In another, it was work among older people. In another, it was social care and concern for the homeless. In another, it was the use of church buildings by the wider community. Common to all sixteen was the fact that a broader community, not just a local congregational, mentality was important. </LI>

<B><LI>Teaching was dominant in each of the churches. </B>Sermons and talks were prepared well and the faith communicated and people taught. Of course, ignorant congregations will have little to share.</LI>

<LI>In each case, <B>lay people were involved in the leadership of the church</B>,<B> </B>with a corresponding abandonment of the traditional ‘one man band’ mentality. Clergy who are afraid to entrust lay people with responsibilities are holding back mission. </LI>

<LI>There was a realistic awareness that <B>different congregations needed</B> <B>different liturgies</B> to meet the different needs of varying age groups. It is typical for the elderly to come to 8:00 am Holy Communion, families at 10:00 am, and young people in the evening. Awareness of these differences has led to growth.</LI>

<B><LI>Excellence in worship</B> is also a key to growth.  Of course, the word ‘excellence’ does not have to mean the same in each place.  It does, however, convey the idea of ‘thoroughness’ in preparation; of being in touch with the needs of the community the Church seeks to serve, as well as reflecting the traditions of our church; and of worship where the standards of music are high and where participation is also emphasised.  Dull, complicated, and poorly led worship, coupled with indifferent teaching, are factors that lead to decline.</LI></OL>


<P>Of course, I doubt whether these six points are particularly new, and I'm sure there are many other places throughout the country where similar things have been identified. What interests me, though, is that this set of characteristics brings together mission and evangelism and helps to create healthy Churches.  </P>

<P>Throughout this lecture, the theme of liturgy or melody has been sounded time and again. The reason for that is deliberate, because mission is essentially a celebration of God’s joy in sharing his love with others. No lover is ever ashamed of his betrothed, no mother is bashful about showing off her newborn, and no new graduate is ashamed to show off her degree or his academic gown. The Church who has celebration at its heart will be instinctively in mission; keen to share, hopeful in its expectation, and constantly in touch with its roots.</P>

<P>As I commenced this lecture with two stories about music and melodies, let me end with two more. </P>

<P>First of all, some years ago I was invited to be the Celebrant at St. Paul’s, Deptford. It is an exceedingly high church in a very deprived area of south London, with many ethnic groups in the parish. It was a very High Mass in the best Anglo-Catholic tradition. After robing in a leisure centre, I approached the church with the Romford Drum Band going before. I entered a packed church with some 100 children in the sanctuary. The children sang, &quot;Consider yourself at home&quot; from &quot;Oliver!&quot; We had some ethnic dances that weaved through that service. The hymns varied from charismatic songs like &quot;Our God Reigns,&quot; to &quot;Jerusalem the Golden&quot;. From &quot;And did those feet&quot; (<I>Jerusalem</I>), to &quot;John Brown’s Body&quot;. And, would you believe it, just before the blessing the band appeared to play &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;!  Then, with hardly an interruption, the service moved into a party, then disco with ethnic foods and a firework display that ended the service. </P>

<P>The final hymn was the modern hymn, &quot;Our God Reigns&quot;. But the printer made two terrible mistakes. In verse two, the printer had printed: &quot;Our <U>Gold</U> Reigns,&quot; which in that poor part of London was a howler of great proportions. In the last verse, instead of &quot;reigns,&quot; an ‘s’ was planted in the middle of the word, which made it read &quot;Our God Resigns&quot; which also made the congregation very amused. Humanly speaking, I would guess that there is much about human life that might make even God give up – but resigning is not his habit! It is his world we are serving; it is his work we are doing; it is in his power that our mission finds its strength – and because he reigns, we can sing and join all those liturgies of celebration going on in our world.</P>

<P>I tell my second and final story with the great Ravinia Music Festival in mind. I am reminded of the story of Karl Barth, the great Protestant theologian, who was a lover of Mozart, a catholic by background. Barth confessed that he was not absolutely certain that &quot;when the angels go about their task of praising God, they play only Bach,&quot; but he was absolutely certain that &quot;when they are together <I>en famille</I>, they play Mozart and that then the good God listens with special pleasure.&quot; It is with temerity I will contradict the great Doctor with only one correction – God’s greatest delight, it seems to me, is when we unite our voices in his liturgy of loving mission. That must be his greatest joy.</P>
