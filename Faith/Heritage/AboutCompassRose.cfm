<p>The Compass Rose is the symbol of the Anglican Communion and the official logo of the Anglican Consultative Council. Designed by Canon Edward West of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City for the second international Anglican Congress in 1954, the Compass Rose is now used throughout the communion as a symbol of the unity and common faith heritage shared by Anglicans.</p>
<p>The design features a red cross of St. George on a silver shield at its center, encircled by the New Testament Greek quotation "The Truth shall make you free." The compass points radiating out from the shield symbolize the world-wide spread of Anglicanism. The miter at the top of the emblem signifies the apostolic order. Archbishop Robert Runcie dedicated the compass rose in the nave floor of Canterbury Cathedral at the final Eucharist of the 1988 Lambeth Conference.</p>
