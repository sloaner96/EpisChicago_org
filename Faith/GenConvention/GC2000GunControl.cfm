<i><p><b>RESOLVED</b>, that Episcopalians in the Diocese of Chicago:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge that the violence in our midst is encouraged and enabled by the presence of	guns.
<li>Ask all members of our church prayerfully to consider making our homes and vehicles safe for everyone, especially children, by removing handguns and assault weapons from those places.
<li>And that this Diocesan Convention memorialize General Convention in 2000 to resolve that Episcopalians nationwide remove handguns and assault weapons from their homes and vehicles.
</ol></i>

<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<p>The outbursts of gun violence this summer in Colorado, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Fort Worth, and here in Chicago in streets, schools, hospitals and churches compel our response. What can we do? Let us begin in our own Episcopal community. Bishop Persell wrote to the diocesan clergy on July 8: "Violence such as that unleashed by Benjamin Smith is encouraged and enabled by the easy availability of guns in the United States. That police are so fearful of being shot leads to police shootings of innocent, unarmed people. We need serious and sensible control of weapons of destruction. Daily children are killed, or injure and kill others, with guns found in their homes. We stand alone in the world in the numbers of our people killed and injured by gun?fire each year."</p>
<p>Christ calls on us to be peacemakers, to disarm the violent and to resolve the disputes that can lead to aggression (Matthew 18: 15?22). God calls on us to work for justice. Our Episcopalian tradition supports a non?violent, peaceful life for children and for all people on Earth. Most of the acts of Christ related in the Gospels are miracles of healing. The blind see, the lame walk, the insane regain their senses. As children of Christ, we attempt to replicate these miracles in our hospitals and doctors offices. Further, we do all in our power to prevent illness and injury, especially those injuries that can lead to death or disability.</p>
<p>The prevalence of guns in our society causes thousands of deaths and injuries in our community every year, both intentional and accidental. If we want to reduce these injuries, we people of faith must work to decrease the number guns around us. We can start by acting on these beliefs in our own homes.</p>
<p>This resolution should not be confused with a political statement on gun control in our country. We recognize the complexity of this issue in the political forum. Rather, we are saying, as a statement of our faith in Christ, that we will not willingly or unwittingly contribute to the violence around us by keeping handguns or assault weapons in our homes.</p>
