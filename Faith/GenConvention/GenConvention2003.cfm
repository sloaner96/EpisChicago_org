Minneapolis Convention Center, Minnesota<br>
July 30–August 8, 2003</p></font>

<font face="Verdana" size="-1">
<p>For two weeks this summer the Episcopal Church will gather for worship, fellowship, formation and debate at the 74th General Convention in Minneapolis, site of the historic 1976 General Convention which opened the priesthood to women. Over 200 bishops, 800 deputies, 1,200 volunteers, and upwards of 5,000 visitors will fill the convention center, hotels and skywalks of this City of the Lakes (22 lakes and lagoons, 170 parks) for the largest bicameral legislative meeting in the world.</p>
<p>Our diocese will be sending <a href="gc2003-deputies.cfm">four clergy</a> and <a href="gc2003-deputies.cfm">four lay deputies</a> and two alternates: The Revs. <b>James Lemler</b> of Seabury-Western Theological Seminary; <b>Bonnie Perry</b> of All Saints, Chicago; <B>Shawn Schreiner</B> of St. James Cathedral; and <B>Richard Tolliver</B> of St. Edmund’s, Chicago as clergy deputies; <B>Patricia Abrams</B> of St. Thomas, Chicago; <B>Tessa Craib-Cox</B> of St. Chrysostom, Chicago; <B>Newland Smith</B> of St. David’s, Glenview;  and <B>Anne Tuohy</B> of St. Elisabeth, Glencoe as lay deputies; and the <B>Rev. Graham Smith</B> of St. David’s, Glenview and <B>Richard Peete</B> of St. Mary’s, Crystal Lake as first alternates. In addition our diocesan Episcopal Church Women will be sending ECW President <B>Laris Gross</B>, UTO coordinator <B>Lisa Pardue</B>, and board members <B>Susan Meehan</B> and <B>Johnnie Newton</B>.</p>
<p>Much of convention’s business will focus on dispatching over 300 resolutions (learn more about the <a href="gc2003-legislativeprocess.cfm">legislative process</a>), but the bishops and deputies will also approve a $146 million budget for the next triennium, and fill openings on four canonical bodies (Church Pension Fund, Executive Council, Examining Board of Chaplains, and General Theological Seminary board). Two members of our diocese have been nominated for national office:  The Rev. Mark Nestlehutt, associate at St. Chrysostom, Chicago is a nominee for Church Pension Fund trustee; and Sandra McPhee of St. Matthew, Evanston is a nominee for Executive Council. Two deputies—the Rev. Richard Tolliver and the Rev. Shawn Schreiner—have been nominated for the Joint Nominating Committee for the Election of the Presiding Bishop. The election for the successor to Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold will take place at the 2006 General Convention.</p>
