<P>I look forward with some fear and trembling, to be sure, to the next 
nine years as your chief pastor and presiding bishop. And right now I 
tell people that this is the season of transfiguration: We are on the 
mountain, but we have to go down the mountain and up to Jerusalem. 
Right now I am enjoying a wonderful, blame-free period. It won't last 
long. But as I look ahead, I am very clear that you are my fellow 
ministers. You are my fellow truth-tellers, grace-bearers, co-discerners of where and what our God is up to and is seeking to 
transform and heal in this broken and sinful world in which we live.</p>
<P>
A colleague of mine has said on numerous occasions: The Episcopal 
Church can only do one thing well: Celebrate failure. And I am aware 
that one of the tactics of the evil one is to fix our attention 
wholly on the negative to the total exclusion of the larger picture. 
And therefore, we have to be particularly mindful of Paul's 
injunction: "Rejoice always in the Lord, and again I say, rejoice."</p>

<P>
Through the discipline of prayer, and encounter with the risen Christ 
in word, sacrament and one another-and conversation at its deepest 
level is all about meeting Christ in one another-we are able to 
recover that larger picture and find ourselves free from the tyranny 
of any single issue.</p>
<P>
Another and more immediate cause for rejoicing is the sacrificial 
ministry-and I use the word sacrificial advisedly-of our Presiding 
Bishop Edmond Browning. I know of no one who deserves the title chief 
pastor more than he does and am deeply grateful, as we all are, that 
he and Patti have kept us focused over the last 12 years on our needy 
and broken world and have not allowed us as a church to become 
completely self-absorbed, even at our worst moments.</p>
<P>
Next January 10, I will formally receive the fruits of his ministry 
symbolized by the primatial cross. I pray that with your prayers and 
collaboration, and I stress collaboration, we may take a step forward 
together into God's future and our own, relying on the transforming 
power of Jesus Christ, the driving motion of the Holy Spirit, and on 
the wings of God's burning love.</p>
<P>
"Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say, rejoice." Amen.</p>
