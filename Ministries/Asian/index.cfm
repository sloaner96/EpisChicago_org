	<TITLE>Chicago Diocese -- Asian Ministries</TITLE>

<blockquote>
<font face="Verdana" size="-1">

<p>The Asian ministry of the diocese is coordinated by a task force of lay people and clergy who work with Cambodian, Indian, Japanese and Korean communities. The task force's work has included a leadership training program and language course at the Reba Place Fellowship in Evanston for Cambodian Christians, and a recent survey of mission development opportunities for the Chinese community in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood.</p>

<p>Asian ministry had its start in the diocese in 1947 when the Rev. Joseph Kitagawa organized a mission to Chicago's Japanese population. St. Peter's, Chicago, on the city's north side, and Church of the Redeemer on the city's south side, became the focal points of this ministry. Assisting Kitagawa were the Rev. Michael Yasutake, later program director at Cathedral Shelter and assisting priest at St. Matthew's, Evanston, and the late Rev. Russell Nakata.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, as Japanese-American members dispersed to other congregations in the suburbs, the diocese's focus shifted to serving the growing Korean population. By 1970 Korean language services were being held at the former North Side parish of St. Stephens under the leadership of the Rev. Matthew Ahn. In 1971, the new Korean congregation-St. Mary's-was accepted as a mission church, and continued to grow. Having outgrown its space, the congregation merged with St. Anselm's mission in Park Ridge to form a joint Anglo and Korean church: One in Christ. </p>

<p>One in Christ is gaining national prominence among Korean Episcopalians for its participation in the annual Asia Ministry Conference and for hosting the Korean Youth Event. The congregation's current vicar, the Rev. Paul Joo, a former priest of the Anglican Church of Korea, was appointed in 1997. He is assisted by Deacon Solomon Lee.</p>
