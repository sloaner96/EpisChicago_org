<p>The Episcopal Diocese of Chicago Summer Camp provides an opportunity for children to learn about God, themselves, others, and the Episcopal Church, through the adventure of  outdoor camp.  The summer camp experience allows young people to develop a greater spiritual awareness of God's presence in their lives.</p>
<p>Our campers will learn new skills, make new friends, and explore the horizons of their faith.  They will come home with a new appreciation of the miracles of creation and their part in it.  These are experiences that will last long after camp is over.  We invite and welcome all young people to share in this experience.</p>
<p>Activities include traditional camp favorites: archery, arts & crafts, basketball, boating, drama, games, hiking, nature, swimming, team-building/ropes course, tent camping, and campfires, plus opportunities to try new experiences.</p>
<p>Christian Education is a daily part of the camp experience.  It is guided by Episcopal clergy and includes such activities as: art, drama, storytelling, informal prayer & worship, outdoor worship, and Eucharistic services. Campers from other faith backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>The body, imagination, and spirit will all receive a good work out, learn some new skills, develop, and grow.</p>
<p>Registration is open to all campers regardless of race, sex, creed, national origin, age, or handicap.</p>
