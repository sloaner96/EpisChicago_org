<h3><font face="Tahoma" color="Navy">History and Tradition</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">

<p>A central and historic part of the mission of the Christian church is to provide support and spiritual direction throughout our lives, particularly at significant turning points  --- birth, baptism, confirmation, marriage, and, eventually death.  Christians from the earliest times have buried their dead in consecrated areas in close proximity to their place of worship.  In earlier times, when much of our country was rural in character, it was traditional for the church to lay the bodies of its dead to rest in churchyards.  Now with increasing urbanization and limited space, many churches, including St. James, are continuing this practice by making available columbarium niches and memorial gardens for the interment of created remains.</p>
<p>The Cathedral offers two options for burial: the outdoor Memorial Garden and the Columbarium located in St. Andrew's Chapel.  Our Memorial Garden is located just outside the entrance to the chapel on Huron Street.  Distinguished landscape architect Joe Karr has designed a garden that is serene and beautiful throughout all seasons of the year.  Ashes will be buried in biodegradable containers, which will be placed under colorful annuals planted on either side of the brick walkway.  A simple engraved nameplate will be placed in St. Andrew's Chapel.</p>
<p>The Garden is a place for families, friends and other visitors to find peace and strength.  Even passerby who might never enter the chapel or the Cathedral will delight in the beauty of this sacred garden.</p>
<p>The Columbarium in St. Andrew's Chapel contains twenty niches, each of which can house one or two urns.  A nameplate engraved with name and dates will be mounted on the outside of the Columbarium; urns and nameplates will be provided.</p>
<p>Future plans include building a Columbarium Oratory adjacent to the chapel.</p>

<h3><font face="Tahoma" color="Navy">Interment at St. James</font></h3>
