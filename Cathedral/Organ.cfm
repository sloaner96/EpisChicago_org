<p>Chances are, while you love the organ music at St. James, you do not know the unique  story about this great instrument.  The cathedral's original organ, located behind the façade pipes on the south side of the cathedral, was installed by the Austin Organ Company in 1920.  The transept organ, located in the musicians gallery near where the choir sits, was installed by the same company in 1961.  The 1930 Aeolian-Skinner console was a gift of Mrs. H. Earl Hoover.</p>

<p>Our organ has been in constant use for over 70 years without a major overhaul-until now.  Starting this past April, and over the next two years, each division or section of both organs will be dismantled, the pipe work repaired, the leather components rebuilt, and the whole organ cleaned of dirt and soot.  New pipe work will be installed, including an antiphonal division featuring the trompette-en-chamade stop or fanfare trumpet which will be used on festive occasions and at such services as weddings.</p>

<p>When completed, our organ will be one of the finest in Chicago.  It will retain its wonderfully warm sound while having additional resources updating its design to that of a 21st century organ building; an instrument capable of playing repertoire written from the 16th through 21st centuries.  The organ will be worth well over $1 million at the conclusion of the rebuilding project.</p>

<p>Fulfilling Our Covenant to Future Generations is the campaign to raise the $600,000 necessary to rebuild the cathedral's organ, restore the tower bells, and purchase a concert grand piano.  We need to raise $250,000 by Jan. 31, 2000 in order to receive a generous $250,000 challenge grant from the H. Earl Hoover Foundation.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has responded so generously.  Please consider a 
gift today and take advantage of this rare opportunity for St. James to 
double your contribution through this challenge grant.  Please send your 
check to the Cathedral office.  For more information, call Sue Jakubowski at (312) 787-7360.</p>
