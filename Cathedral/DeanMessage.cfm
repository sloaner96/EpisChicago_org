<p>Hello Chicago! Here we are! </p>

<p>Now, it might seem unusual to some of you that I am preaching at my own installation service - I assure you that I do have friends who would happily have preached. However, it often seems that in such celebrations one hears little or nothing from the new dean or rector, and Bishop Persell and I both thought that this would be a great opportunity for the wider communities that are gathered here to begin to hear some of the vision and dreams I hold for the Cathedral's ministry and witness.</p>

<p>The day after I received and accepted the call to come to St. James, my director of music at St. Andrew's in Tacoma (who enjoys practical jokes) left me a symbol … A "Cow" in a dress with a lantern that lights - no doubt, Mrs. O'Leary's cow. </p>

<p>For me, it has become a symbol of the new Fire of Chicago we are called to kindle, which is to set the city afire with the reconciling, forgiving, healing, restorative and compassionate heart of the Spirit.</p>

<p>What a time in history to be beginning a new relationship and partnership in ministry. The world is tuning back in to the great spiritual questions of the ages, and we have a mission to meet and greet the fullness of humanity with the love and compassion of God we know in Christ. These are the questions that were before the friends of Jesus as he paired them up and sent them out as harvesters, with nothing more than the proclamation of hope - "peace be to this house."</p>

<p>In a recent interview I was asked this question: "What message and relevancy does the Church have in a post-Christendom, post-modern, millennial-generation world? What is its role?"</p>

<p>I replied, "To Proclaim!"<br>
To proclaim</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The radical, inclusive, extravagant hospitality and love of God
<li>To announce to those we meet that the domain of God is upon them and they are beloved of God.
<li>It is the same message - for all time.
</ul>

<p>This has huge ramifications for how we are called to live our ministry as a Cathedral community. That we hold reaching out to all our neighbors, with all the partnerships - civic, interfaith & ecumenical - that we can forge, with a heart of extravagant hospitality as a core Gospel Imperative value.</p>

<p>What does this hospitality look like when it is lived out?</p>

<p>What do our personal stories mean for the congregation of St. James and the community of the diocese and the city who look to this place as their Cathedral? </p>

<p>It is about becoming a place of compassion and comfort for all, regardless of age, race, culture, the poor, the wealthy, the marginalized, those in the "mainstream" all those people who are hurting/searching.  This compassion and comfort is not "vs." or either/or, but inclusive/ incorporative.</p>

<p>Growing churches are characterized by a commitment to mission. Traditional church models are focused upon saving the Church - the institution. The mission church thinks about how to reach the world. This is worked out through a clear and positive identity; a consistent focus on people who tentatively gather in the shadows and margins of our life of faith, and on those who are not members; congregational - and in our case, diocesan - harmony; a positive dynamic between the clergy leadership and the congregation; and programming that responds to the real needs in the community with the transformational, liberating grace of the gospel. This is lived out by a commitment to faithfulness and being the best we can be with the gifts God has given us.</p>

<p>Gospel Imperatives and how each will be worked out:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ecumenically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- interfaith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- community</p>

<p>It is Imperative that we seek and serve Christ in all persons…" and "…respect the dignity of every human being."</p>

<p>We are not here to do our "stuff" in the world, but God's "stuff." And at the end of my time here with you, I want to be able to celebrate that this Cathedral church of St. James is widely known for what it's community does and proclaims - even if few know who her Dean is.</p>

<p>So, with Mrs. O'Leary's cow, we need to take courage as we light Chicago ablaze with the compassion of Christ.</p>
