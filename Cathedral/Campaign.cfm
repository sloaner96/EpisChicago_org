Cathedral launches capital campaign<br>

<p>Music speaks to our soul-inspiring, consoling and sustaining us as God's witness in the world.  At St. James Episcopal Cathedral, we have honored and celebrated God's gift of music for over 150 years.  </p>

<p>Did you know that our organ-one of first to be installed in Chicago-has been in constant use for over 70 years?  While routine repairs have been performed over the years, it now needs a major overhaul.</p>

<p>Several years ago, a committee was formed to discern a plan for this aging instrument.  Was it better to replace it completely or to restore the original?  After substantial research and reflection, the committee unanimously choose to restore the cathedral's organ.  While restoration would be expensive, it would cost far less than the $1,000,000 price of a new organ.  </p>

<p><b><i>Fulfilling Our Covenant to Future Generations</i></b> is the campaign to raise the $600,000 necessary to restore the <a href="/Cathedral/Organ.cfm">cathedral's organ and tower bells</a> and to purchase a concert grand piano rather than continue to rent one for the many performances at St. James throughout the year.</p>

<p>We must raise $250,000 by Jan. 31, 2000 in order to receive a generous $250,000 challenge grant from The H. Earl Hoover Foundation.  To further underscore the importance of this initiative, John and Norma Bramsen have also generously pledged to match dollars contributed to the campaign.  For every dollar newly pledged to the organ restoration and paid before Sept. 30, 1999, they will contribute a dollar toward the tower bells restoration up to the total cost of that project.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has responded so generously, we have been able to stay on track with our ongoing payments to the Bradford Organ Company and the down payment to the Verdin Company to be on their schedule for the September/October renovation of the tower bells.</p>

<p>Won't you be among the group of individuals that helps our generation do its part to sustain the musical legacy of St. James Cathedral?  Please consider a gift today and take advantage of this rare opportunity for St. James to multiply your contribution through the two matching grants.  </p>

<p>Please send your check to the cathedral office or call Sue Jakubowski at (312) 787-7360 for more information.  Thank you for your support!</p>
