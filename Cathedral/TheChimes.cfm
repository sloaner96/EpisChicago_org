<P>The placing of a chime of bells in the tower of St. James’ church during the last week marks an epoch in the history of the mother of the Episcopal church in the west, and is an acquisition of which even Chicago may be proud.  They are the munificent gift of the children of the late James Carter, and are a noble monument to his memory.  Mr. Carter was for some time a banker in Galena, and after proving himself a liberal benefactor of the church there, he moved to Chicago in 1860, and was among the first to respond to the effort of Bishop Whitehouse to establish the cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul.  Upon the death of his wife, in 1862, as a tribute to her worth, he placed in the cathedral a marble font, beautifully carved, and bearing a close resemblance to the font in St. Thomas Church, New York.  To that font his children, in the fall of the present year, added an appropriate cover of brass, imported from England.  The later years of Mr. Carter were spent in New York, and he died in that city in 1873.</P>

<P>The chime of bells given by his children to St. James church, if not the largest, will probably prove one of the finest in the country.  They are 10 in number, and their weight is about 11,000 pounds, distributed as follows according to their respective keys: E flat, 3,100 pounds; F, 2,000 pounds; G, 1,550 pounds; A flat, 1,225 pounds; B flat 825 pounds; C 525 pounds;  D flat (flat 7), 475 pounds; D, 450 pounds; E flat, 360 pounds; F, 275 pounds.</P>

<P>Upon the largest, or tenor bell, is the following inscription:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">This Chime of Ten Bells<br>
Is given to<br>
St. James’ Church,<br>
Chicago, Ill.,<br>
In Memory of<br>
James Carter,<br>
Born at Aberdeen, Scotland,<br>
May 29, 1817.<br>
Died at New York City,<br>
April 18, 1873.<br>
By his Children,<br>
Christmas, 1876.</P>

<P>Each bell, commencing with the tenor, is inscribed with a verse of Venite Exultimus, or the 95<SUP>th</SUP> psalm, as found in the prayer-book, the last verse being divided, and placed upon the two smallest bells.  This psalm has, from the beginning,  been used to introduce the services of the chapel, and is found in all the early liturgies.  It is called the initiatory psalm, and is peculiarly appropriate for inscription upon these bells which call us to &quot;sing unto the Lord a new song.&quot;</P>

<P>The chimes of St. James’ came from the widely celebrated foundry of Meneely &amp; Kimberly, Troy, N.Y., and Mr. Meneely, with his foreman, Mr. Dyer, has come on to supervise the hanging of them.  Mr. Walter F. Marsh, who has made quite a reputation for himself by his skillful handling of the chime of St. Peter’s, Albany, rang the first peal on the bells, and will instruct the son of the Rev. Mr. Bredburg in the mystery, and he will be the ringer of St. James’.</P>

<P>By way of comparison, a list of some of the more noted chimes in the country and in the west is appended, with their weight, the first four being from the same foundry with the chime of St. James’.  It will be seen that but three of the chimes are superior to the latter in weight, and but two in the number of bells: St. Peter’s, Albany, 11 bells, 11,500 pounds; St. Luke’s, Darien, Conn., 7,500 pounds; the Yale peal, two bells; Church of the Pilgrims, St. Louis, 10 bells, 11,000 pounds; Trinity, New York, from England, tenor bell, 3,081 pounds; Grace, New York, 10 bells, 10,520 pounds, tenor bell 2,835 pounds; St. Thomas’, New York, 10 bells, 10,519 pounds tenor bell, 2,779 pounds; Christ, Indianapolis, nine bells, 5920 pounds, tenor bell, 1,617; St. John’s Milwaukee, five bells, 2,428 pounds, tenor bell, 800 pounds; St. James’, Milwaukee, nine bells, 9,823 pounds, tenor, 2476; Trinity, Pittsburgh, 10 bells, 12,602 pounds, tenor, 3,453 pounds; Christ, Detroit, nine bells, 9,708 pounds, tenor, 2,410 pounds; Grace, Madison, Wis., nine bells, 9,597 pounds, tenor, 2,531 pounds; Michigan Avenue Baptist, Chicago, 17 bells, 17,860 pounds, tenor, 3,656 pounds.</P>

<P>The last chime, for some reason, has not been rung for the last two years, and it is impossible to speak advisedly of its quality.  There is a small peal of bells on St. Francis’ church, Twelfth street.</P>

<P>To constitute a chime of bells, they must be tuned to diatonic intervals, whereas a peal is attuned to harmonic intervals.  Thus a set of bells upon the eight notes of the scale is a chime, and a set upon the first, third, fifth, and eighth is a peal.  The smallest number that can compose a chime is five, but eight would seem to be the natural number, corresponding to the notes of the scale.  The addition of an extra bell, giving the note of the flat seventh, as in the chime of St. James’ creates a new series of diatonic tones in the key of the fourth, and allows music of two different keys.</P>

<P>The number of changes that can be rung on a peal or chime of bells, and the rapid progression of them, according to the number of the bells, is something marvelous, as may be seen from the following:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>Four bells, 24 changes, called singles, rung in one minute.<br>
Six bells, 720 changes, called minor, rung in 30 minutes.<br>
Ten bells, 3,628,800 changes, called royal, rung in one year, 105 days.<br>
Twelve bells, 479,001,600 changes, called maximus, rung in 37 years 355 days.</P>
</blockquote>

<P>Thus it will be seen that it will take the ringer at St. James’ one year and 105 days of steady continuous work to show what the new chime can do.  These bells are made of Lake Superior copper and new tin, in the proportion of 78 to 22, and without any admixture of silver, which contrary to the popular impression, impairs rather than improves the sound.</P>

<P>Last evening a dedicatory service was held in the St. James’ chapel, by the bishop of the diocese, and the rector, the Rev. Dr. Harris, Dr. Cushman, and Canon Knowles also being present, with others, and the chapel was filled.  The bells then began to chime and the following tunes were played, &quot;Antioch,&quot; &quot;The Heavens Are Telling,&quot; &quot;Vesper Hymn,&quot; &quot;Hark, Hark, My Soul,&quot; &quot;Change Melody,&quot; by Mr. Marsh; &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; or Portuguese hymn, and &quot;Home Sweet Home.&quot;  There was but one voice as to the purity of the tones and the beauty of the music.  It was as near perfection as it could well be, and Messrs. Meneely &amp; Kimberly may well be proud of their work.  The severe weather has a very unfavorable tendency to add sharpness to the sound, and the chime will not be able to bring out all its sweetness and power until the atmospheric conditions are more favorable.  But the trial last evening stamped the character of the chime, and if there was any defect only the bell-founders themselves could discover it.  With a rector in the pulpit like Dr. Harris, and the Carter chime in the tower, St. James’ looks forward to a long career of prosperity.  Long may the chime conserve the memory of the Father in honor of whom, upon His birthday, the chime shall ring out its most melodious notes, while at the same time it bears witness to a wealth of filial love in the children as honorable to their Father as to themselves.</P>
