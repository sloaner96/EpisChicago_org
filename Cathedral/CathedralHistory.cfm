<H3>THE CHURCH</H3>
<P>
Saint James parish, the oldest Episcopal church in Chicago, is
one of the oldest in Illinois. Chicago, in 1833, was as a town
of 350 people living near Fort Dearborn.  In 1834, John and Juliette
Kinzie brought Isaac Williams Hallam, the first Priest to the
area.  Choosing the name of his Connecticut church, Saint James,
Hallam organized the parish on November 2, 1834, in a North Water
Street auction house. First services were held in a new brick
church on land donated by John Kinzie at Cass (presently Wabash)
and Illinois Streets on Easter, 1837, the year Chicago incorporated
as a city of over 4,000 people.<BR>
<P>
The parish of Saint James was the chief source of Anglican outreach
in Northern Illinois and became the &quot;mother&quot; church
for the area. Even in the beginning, Hallam, a missionary-minded
priest, conducted services in then distant places like Joliet,
Lockport, Peoria, Michigan City, and Waukegan.  Saint James was
responsible for the organization of many other Chicago parishes.
The earliest, Trinity (1842), was the first southside Episcopal
Church. By the turn of the century, Saint James' many missions
included Ascension and Saint Chrysostom.<BR>
<P>
Services began at the present location in 1857. As one of the
largest churches in Chicago and home parish of many business leaders,
Saint James was a natural choice of travelers to visit while in
the growing city. That may have been why Abraham Lincoln, not
an Episcopalian or a regular churchgoer, attended a service here
in 1860, the day after his election to the presidency.  A plaque
set in the north wall of the Narthex speaks of this.<BR>
<P>
As many in the Saint James families served during the Civil War,
the parish, after the war, erected an elaborate memorial &quot;In
honor of those who fought&#133; in memory of those who fell.&quot;
The ornate mid-Victorian monument at the base of the bell tower
at the north end of the Narthex was designed by Frederick Law
Olmstead of Vaux, Withers and Olmstead of New York. To guarantee
that it would last for all time, the family of Chicago's first
mayor, William B. Ogden, made certain funds were provided to make
the memorial fireproof.<BR>
<P>
The final completion and dedication of the church structure, designed
by Edward Burling, was celebrated in September, 1871. On October
9, the second day of the Great Fire of 1871, the church was destroyed,
but the bell tower with its monument and the nearby Water Tower
were the only surviving structures left in this portion of Chicago
north of the river. When the fire rubble had been cleared away.
a temporary chapel for 250 people was constructed in the Narthex
with the Civil War memorial serving as the altar, and the rebuilding
began with the hiring of architects Clarke and Faulkner.<BR>
<P>
Other Narthex features include a collection of old memorial plaques
moved from various parts of the church to this space in 1922 and
the Narthex windows installed in 1962. The west wall group has
a Christ-in-Majesty and apocalyptic angels over the doors. The
south windows depict Saint James, the Blessed Virgin Mary and
Saint John. Flanking the main entrance are symbols for Saint James
from the bible (martyr's sword ) and from the great pilgrimage
(staff and waterpouch) to Santiago de Compostela.<BR>
<P>
Miraculously, exactly four years after the fire, on October 9,
1875, services were held in the rebuilt church, basically the
structure in use today, which seats 700 people. In 1888-89, E.
J. NeviIle Stent of New York, well-known for his English Arts
and Crafts Movement church interiors, created the stenciling used
in the sanctuary. Although the decor of the church was modified
several times during the twentieth century, the prize-winning
1985 Holabird and Root restoration by Walker Johnson returned
original, hundred-year-old stencils and 26 colors to the interior
to provide what an expert calls the best example of this Victorian
stencil work in the world.<BR>
<P>
At the nave entrance. the font, one of Chicago's finest examples
of Italian marble sculpture, was carved by Augusta Freeman, a
woman, in 1874.<BR>
<P>
Most of the sanctuary windows date from the end of the last century
and are finely painted glass. With biblical subject matter and
rich symbols, these Victorian period &quot;jewels&quot; were gifts
of many Chicago leaders who were Saint James' members. The choir
loft &quot;rose&quot; window shows a Christ-in-Majesty surrounded
by angel musicians. The choir's English windows show biblical
events involving Saint James, the Transfiguration and the Garden
of Gethsemane.  The altar windows, based on the Epiphany, Crucifixion
and Ascension, were given in memory of the Rev. James DeKoven.
They were lengthened in 1962 when the marble altar and floor were
installed.<BR>
<P>
The carved wood and painted reredos, showing another Christ-in-Majesty,
was given to honor long-time rector, the Rt. Rev. Robert H. Clarkson
in 1884.<BR>
<P>
Choirmaster and Organist Leo Sowerby played the Cathedral organ
installed in 1920 and housed in the south transept behind the
1875 Johnson case. A new 4-manual console and a north transept
organ were installed in 1968. Today. the entire instrument has
60 ranks. World and American premiers have been among the Cathedral's
sacred music presentations.<BR>
<P>
After the first American cathedral, Saints Peter and Paul, was
lost to fire, Saint James became the Cathedral of the Diocese
of Chicago in 1955. The &quot;cathedra&quot; or bishop's chair
has the diocesan coat-of-arms on both the front and back. The
needlepoint there was done by Dr. Jackson W. Riddle, who guided
the talents of Episcopalians across the diocese to create all
the rich variety of Cathedral needlepoint.<BR>
<P>
<H3>CHAPEL OF SAINT ANDREW</H3>
<P>
Perhaps the best known feature of the Cathedral is Saint Andrew's
Chapel. It marks the site where James L. Houghteling and his bible
class of twelve young men heard a derelict alcoholic tell them
of once belonging to a Society of Saint Andrew and Saint Philip
whose purpose was to seek out men and bring them to the Church.
While the class was unable to do much for the visitor, they were
struck with the idea of the society he had described and founded
the Brotherhood of Saint Andrew in 1893. Now an international
organization with hundreds of chapters and thousands of members,
its purpose is to bring young men to Christ and his Church. In
the gospel, Saint Andrew brings a young man with the five loaves
and two small fishes to Jesus, who turns it to food to feed five
thousand.<BR>
<P>
The Chapel was completed in 1913 as a gift of the family of James
L. Houghteling. The design, by Bertram G. Goodhue, closely follows
that of an abbot's private oratory in an ancient abbey in Southern
Scotland. Saints prominent in the British Isles are depicted in
the painted window glass, which like some of the wall stones,
came from the old abbey. The Italian altar with its richly decorated
triptych reredos with its baldachin or canopy reproduces the Scottish
original, For festival use, silver accessories were designed by
Ralph Adams Cram. The lighted sanctuary lamp indicates that the
Blessed Sacrament of Christ's Body is reserved in the aumbry on
the south wall of the Sanctuary waiting to be carried as Holy
Communion to the sick. Daily Eucharists are held in the chapel.

<P>
<H3>DIOCESAN CENTER AND CATHEDRAL HOUSE</H3>
<P>
Immediately east of the Cathedral on Huron Street is the building
completed in 1968 housing the offices of the Diocese of Chicago
and the Cathedral of Saint James.  Designed by the architectural
firm of Hammond and Roesche, the Cathedral Center with its Plaza
is a contemporary statement which is complementary to the Victorian
architecture of the Cathedral. Its openness of design and utilization
of space, won it an American Institute of Architects award in
1971.<BR>
<P>
The Center and the Plaza are used for a variety of religious and
community activities acknowledging the Cathedral's role in the
life of the city and its mission to the residents of a modern
urban environment. Several hundred people gather each Wednesday
noon in warm weather for Summerfest performances on the Plaza
stage.  Crowds drawn from the vast Diocese of Chicago take part
in the annual Pilgrimage to the Cathedral on Saint James and the
Passing On the Gift for the Heifer Project each Epiphany.<BR><br><br>
