<P>In 1920, a contract with the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut was signed for a 4-manual, 40 rank organ, which was to be installed behind the 1875 Johnson Organ Case.  This was the fourth organ to be housed in the present building.</P>

<P>This was a typical Austin of its period; it was built upon a large, walk-in Universal Air Chest for which Austin was so famous.  It used electro-pneumatic key and stop actions; 2 ½&quot; thick horizontal Swell shades for each enclosed division and placed under 7 ½&quot; wind pressure.  The manual compass was 61 notes although all manual divisions were placed on 73-note chest.  The Great division with the exception of the 16’ Double Open and 8’ Principal Diapason was enclosed in the Choir box.  The cost of this organ was $18,800 ($650,000 today).</P>

<P>This is the instrument that Dr. Leo Sowerby came to know when he was appointed Organist-Choirmaster in 1927; a position he held for 35 years.</P>

<P>St. James was designated the Cathedral Church of the Chicago Diocese in 1955.  In 1961 the Chancel area of the interior was modified to reflect the evolution of Liturgy in the late 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.  Among these changes was the transition of the choir and organ console to the Musicians’ Gallery; a space created by building up the North Transept.  Dr. Sowerby was concerned about the organ’s distance from the singers and designed a 2-manual and pedal, 15-rank Transept Organ which was installed in a chamber of the east wall of the North Transept.  The Austin Organ Company was again called upon to build this instrument along with a new 4-manual, floating tablet console complete with 16 general pistons to operate both organs.</P>

<P>By the mid 1990’s it became increasingly apparent that a complete overhaul of both organs was very necessary; the leather actions were worn; much of the pipework in need of repair; the pipe chambers in dire need of cleaning and the console nearly inoperable.  A committee was appointed to study various options as to the disposition of both organs and make appropriate recommendations to the Chapter based upon the liturgical needs and aesthetic desires of the Cathedral.</P>

<P>The Austin instrument built in 1920 has given excellent service over the past 70 plus years and immense pleasure to many but has not been without its critics.  Its abundance of 8’pitch, lack of an independent Pedal division and &quot;enclosed&quot; Great division have caused the organ to be very limited.  Its unique sound combined with the good acoustics of the building and its historical importance, however, provide credence for its being rebuilt and tonally updated rather than replaced.  The intention behind this rebuilding is to respect the integrity of the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century sound while at the same time adding essential upperwork, mutations, an independent Pedal and unenclosed Great yielding a much more versatile instrument.  Also envisioned is the addition of a 5-stop, 8-rank Antiphonal division to be located on the West wall of the Cathedral.  Included in this division is a Trompette-en-Chamade (Fanfare Trumpet) located over the central entrance.  The 1961 Transept Organ, built to be used as choir accompaniment, has never been a successful &quot;partner&quot; to the 1920 instrument.  This organ is to be entirely revoiced and tonal additions made resulting in a completely independent organ that may be used in close collaboration with the Main organ or as a separate instrument.  Both organs have been labeled &quot;Romantic;&quot; they will surely retain that label by many but with a cleaner, brighter sound much in the style of what has been termed the &quot;American Classic Organ.&quot;</P>

<P>In 1991, Mrs. H. Earl Hoover of the Hoover Foundation in Glencoe, Illinois made a gift of a 1930 Aeolian-Skinner, 4-manual drawknob console to the Cathedral.  This console originally operated the large Aeolian-Skinner organ in Royce Hall of UCLA, Los Angeles.</P>

<P>In 1996, the bid for the rebuilding and tonal updating of the Cathedral Organs and Aeolian-Skinner console was awarded to the Bradford Organ Company of Evanston, Illinois.  In Mid-1996, the 1961 Austin console completely failed.  A contract was signed with the Bradford Organ Company for the rebuilding and modernizing of the Aeolian-Skinner console, which was installed in 1997.  A campaign was launched in 1998 to raise funds for the rebuilding project as well as the purchase of a grand piano and the refurbishing of the Tower Bells.  In 1999, the contract for the organ project was signed with the Bradford Organ Company.  Also, in 1999, the 2-manual, 26 stop, 35 rank organ built by the Ernest M. Skinner Organ Company in 1928 for the Lyric Opera of Chicago was made available to the Cathedral.  The Skinner Organ Company (later called The Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company) was the most prominent and, arguably by some, the finest organ builder in America during the early to mid 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.  The Cathedral enthusiastically accepted the generous offer of the wonderful Skinner pipework and chests.  This organ will be restored and provide the central pipework for this rebuilding project.  Over the next two years, each division of both organs will be cleaned, rebuilt and tonal additions made according to the specification drawn up by Dr. Crosbie, Bradford Organ Company and the Organ Committee.  When completed, the Skinner/Austin Organ, the sixth organ associated with St. James, the fifth housed in the present building, will contain 95 ranks (over 5,800 pipes and a replacement cost of $1,400,000) and be divided into 9 divisions.</P>

<P>New pipework as indicated.  All other pipes are from the 1920/1961 Austin organs and the 1928 Skinner Organ although some will be revoiced, renamed, and transferred to different divisions. The air pressure of both organs is to be retained, as will the 73-note chests of the Main organ and the 68-note chests of the Transept Organ.</P>
