<font face="Verdana" size="-1">
<p>This is my first opportunity to greet everyone in the diocese. Thanksgiving, excitement, some trepidation, and the mourning of what we are leaving behind in Cleveland are all part of  this transitional time for Nancy and me. We are most appreciative of your prayers, greetings, and the enthusiastic and warm welcome we have received in the diocese.</p>
<p>The search committee, chaired by Marian Faldet and co-chaired by The Rev. Ted Curtis, did an excellent job of keeping all potential nominees informed throughout the process in a timely manner and made our visits to Chicago enjoyable and productive. They set a new high standard for Episcopal elections.</p>
<p>Until the first ballot I had no idea where I would stand in the voting. With five strong nominees, I did not allow myself to think very much about the possibility of being the next bishop of Chicago. Until the "walk about" when I started meeting more and more of you, it was hard to even want to move from a ministry where I have been very happy and fulfilled, to something which was different, challenging and unknown.</p>
<p>I sense God's involvement in all of this and try to remain open to the Holy Spirit. I know that the years ahead will stretch me and call forth all my gifts and resources. I also know that I am not alone. I come into a strong diocese with gifted leadership, a living tradition, sound diocesan staff, human and material resources, a diversity of views, and a predecessor who was and is an inspiring leader of the church. I am also generously supported by the warmth and wisdom of Bishop Donovan.</p>
<p>Some have asked how I feel filling Bishop Griswold's shoes. If that were what I was called to do,  I would feel intimidated. (I know Frank Griswold, and I'm no Frank Griswold.) I take heart in the fact that you have chosen me, and despite the myriad transferences and projections which come with the position, I will try to be myself and will pray daily for the grace to be a faithful and effective bishop of the church.</p>
<p>Nancy and I have found a condo on Lake Shore Drive north of Lincoln Park, just eleven blocks from Wrigley Field! We'll move the end of January.</p>
<p>Pending necessary consents from around the church of bishops and standing committees, the consecration has been set for 2 p.m. on March 13 at Elmhurst College's gymnasium. I hope that this service will be a joyful celebration for the whole diocese, the wider church, and the ecumenical community. Please plan now to be present. Busing and car pooling might help those who could not otherwise be there to attend. Children are welcome and there will be child care for babies. The site is handicapped accessible. I hope any family and friends from across the country will be greeted by the full diversity of our diocese as we come together to launch, with God's blessing, our new ministry together.</p>
<p>Until that time, please keep us in your prayers as you are in ours. Have a blessed and joyous Christmas.</p>

<p>Faithfully yours in Christ,</p>
