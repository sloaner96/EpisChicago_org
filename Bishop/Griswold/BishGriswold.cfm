<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Perspective:</FONT></B> &quot;I deeply believe
God in Christ is making all things new. I mean it's an absolute,
fundamental conviction. I believe it is true with respect to me
personally; I think it is true with respect to us as a diocese.
. . . I find that's the heart of it, that whole notion that I
am a minister of transformation under aegis of the transforming
Spirit of God.&quot;<BR>
