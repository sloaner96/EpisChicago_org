<p align=center><b><font face="Tahoma" color="Purple">A PASTORAL LETTER<br> TO THE PEOPLE OF THE DIOCESE OF CHICAGO</font></b><br>August 25, 1998</p>

<p><font color="Navy"><b>Dear Sisters and Brothers in Christ</b>:</font></p>

<p>We, your Standing Committee and Provisional Bishop, write to you concerning the enclosed <a href="News/nb-980901-1.cfm">resolution on sexuality</a> which the Lambeth Conference passed on August 5, 1998. The conference did not include retired bishops and therefore Bishop Donovan did not attend. Although this world-wide gathering of Anglican bishops is a time for reflection and prayer having no legislative authority over any member church, its resolutions are seen as significant expressions of the mind of our bishops.</p>

<p>We are particularly concerned about the clause, "rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture." We disagree with this statement. We believe that there is much room for debate and no unified understanding of sexuality within our sacred texts. While some people may respond to this scriptural ambiguity by seeking the comfort of moral absolutes, as your diocesan leaders we commend love, respect, and prayerful listening as the witness and discipline of a Christian community and a fair-minded democratic society.</p>

<p>We are well aware of the Old and New Testament texts so often used to condemn homosexuality.  More important, however, are the words of Jesus himself, particularly in the Parable of the Great Feast.   This parable appears twice in the gospels and once in an extra-canonical text. This triple repetition suggests that it played an important role in the life of the early Church and records for modern believers Jesus' own statement about the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>All versions of the parable use approximately the same language: "Bring in whomever you can find." Outcasts are specifically included. In other stories and parables Jesus further emphasizes the abundance  of the kingdom and its inclusivity.  Everyone is invited to the table and everyone may share in the meal.</p>

<p>In the face of ambiguous scriptural texts about sexuality, we invite you to dwell on this lucid parable of the Great Feast. Because we love this parable and other Jesus sayings, because we take our scriptures seriously, we remain committed to our diocesan vision statement:</p>
