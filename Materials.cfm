<font face="Verdana" color="Navy">Lenten Disciplines</font></h3>
<p>The season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday. The choice of a discipline by which to keep the liturgical season of Lent is, perhaps more than any other of our spiritual practices, problematic for many Christians. Lent often leads to regression rather than growth. Many of us choose to ignore Lent. Others of us dismiss it by giving up chocolate or by performing some other equally shallow observance. Nevertheless the point of any liturgical season and any spiritual practice is that we grow and be healthy. It should therefore be possible to choose a lenten discipline which is a positive activity which calls us into the depths of our being. <a href="/Diocese/Offices/PastoralCare/LentenDiscipline.cfm"><img src="/images/Read.gif" width=50 height=15 alt="Read the article" border="0"></a></p>
