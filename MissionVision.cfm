		fruition with precision and timeliness. While we do not anticipate a flood, it is clear that the ark that is the
		church rides on rough seas. We live in a similar time that requires faith, dedication, and planning. As Noah
		did in his time, we are trying to discern God’s plan for our diocese now.</p>
		
		<p>In November 2002 the Diocesan Convention unanimously endorsed a proposal from the Strategic Planning
		Committee for a five-year Strategic Plan commencing in 2003. The committee, building upon the previous
		work of the Long Range Planning Committee and with input from the 2001 Diocesan Convention, diocesan
		governing bodies and congregations, fashioned a vision statement to help members of our diocesan
		community live out our mission statement. In support of this vision, the committee drafted a set of ten specific 
		and measurable goals designed to fulfill the three key points of the vision: changing lives through evangelism
		and lifelong Christian formation, building a vibrant family of congregations and ministries, and striving for
		social justice, peace and abundant life in our diocese and world.</p>
		
		<p>The goals will be the way in which we live out the vision of our diocese over the next five years. As the plan
		moves forward, the committee will set appropriate measures, targets and ownership for each of the goals.</p></font>
