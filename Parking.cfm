<font face="Verdana" size="-1">

<p>The Cathedral and Diocesan Center stand on the block bordered by HURON (one way WEST), WABASH (two-way), ERIE (one way EAST) and RUSH (one way NORTH).  Many of the streets in the area are one way.  We will give as many indications as we can.</p>

<p>In the last few years, there has been a building boom in this area, and many of your favorite (cheap) parking lots are now high-rise buildings or construction sites. Parking has become less available and more expensive.  As a General rule: The further west you go, the less expensive the parking will be.</p>
<p>Because of major subway construction in front of Holy Name Cathedral, State Street is blocked between Chicago Ave and Superior.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: We have done our very best to provide a comprehensive list of available parking lots/garages WEST OF MICHIGAN AVENUE with current prices, but the rates and special early bird prices are subject to change. Prices quoted do not include city tax. <b>Check the details before you park</b>.</i></p>

<br>
