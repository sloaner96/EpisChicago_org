<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800040" SIZE="+1">Geography and Demographics</FONT></B></P>

<P>The Diocese of Chicago comprises twenty-two counties located in
the northern third of the state of Illinois, stretching from the
shores of Lake  Michigan on the east, to the banks of the Mississippi
River on the west.  Its northern boundary is the state of Wisconsin;
the southernmost city is Watseka. Over 8.6 million people live in
this part of the state, of which 65.9% are white, 18,5% African
American, 12.2% Hispanic, and 3% Asian American.  Hispanics and Asian
Americans are the fastest growing segments of this population, and it
is estimated that the number of Hispanics, for example, will increase
by 12.9% between 1997 and 2002.</P>

<P>Outlying areas of the diocese include the 1.1 million people who
live in the fourteen counties outside the six counties of the Chicago
metropolitan  area.  The three counties of metropolitan Rockford
contain the area’s largest population concentration and comprise the
second largest urban center in Illinois, with a population of
352,369.  Other larger cities include Kankakee in the south and
DeKalb and Freeport in the west.  Many of the larger towns have
significant minority populations.  Although the economy of the region
is generally very healthy, several larger communities are struggling
with problems associated with poverty.</P>

<P>Numerous small towns in these areas are two to three driving hours
away from downtown Chicago.  The region’s black earth is famous for
yielding corn and soybeans.  Farming and  agricultural-related
industries form the economic backbone of much of this portion of the
diocese.  A number of communities are also home to major
manufacturing facilities for the production of a wide variety of
products, ranging from glass bottles in Streator to Chrysler
automobiles in Belvidere.  Open space, lower living costs, corn
fields stretching to the horizon and short commuting times to work
are highly valued by those persons who live and work here.</P>

<P>Chicago suburbs form the outer rim of a half moon around the city.
 A majority (two out of three) of the metropolitan area’s citizens
live in these communities.  Although 2,375,000 persons reside in Cook
County suburbs, a somewhat larger number (2,467,000) are located in
the other five metropolitan counties. The suburbs include some of the
wealthiest towns in the nation–Riverwoods, for example, with a median
1989 income of $125,000 — as well as some of the poorest (Ford
Heights, for example, with a 1989 median income of $14,032).  Of the
metropolitan area’s top ten publicly held companies, ranked by
revenues in 1996, six have their headquarters in the suburbs.  The
metropolitan area contains some smaller cities which are sizable in
their own right: chiefly Joliet, Aurora, Elgin, and Waukegan.</P>

<P>Suburbs, like neighborhoods in the city of Chicago, differ
considerably one from another.  Some suburban communities have small
quaint downtown areas which residents have striven mightily to
preserve.  Others have virtually nothing but residential homes, and
still others are home to long strips of commercial development along
major traffic arteries or are dominated by large shopping malls.  A
few are stagnant, while others are booming.</P>

<P>The city of Chicago, located on the southwest shore of Lake
Michigan, is the heart of the third largest metropolitan area in
America.  As a center for commerce, industry, finance, and
transportation, Chicago's economic might is felt throughout the
Midwest and the nation.  It is a city where many businesses locate
their headquarters but not their manufacturing facilities.  Its
lively downtown features excellent shopping, diverse entertainment, a
plethora of restaurant options and  large hotels that attract major
conventions. Its principal airport, O'Hare International Airport,
prides itself as the busiest in the world. Its facilities are
augmented by the older Midway Airport, together with Meigs Field, a
lake front facility that serves small airlines and private aircraft.
A controversial transportation issue is the possible development of a
third major airport at Peotone, located forty-two miles south of
Chicago.</P>

<P>Chicago's cultural and institutional resources are considerable.
Its museum collections, which include the Art Institute, the Field
Museum of Natural History, and the Museum of Science and Industry,
are an attraction for scholars and tourists alike. The musical scene
is expansive, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performing at its
recently renovated Symphony Center, and the Lyric Opera at its
expanded facilities at the Civic Opera House.  There are in addition
many small and mid-size arts organizations to enrich our cultural
life.</P>

<P>Chicago is the home of many institutions of higher education:
Illinois Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, the
University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Chicago are
perhaps best known.  A number of smaller and lesser-known
universities, such as DePaul University, Northeastern Illinois
University, Loyola University, and Roosevelt University, to name a
few, enhance that luster. The city is home to a fine city-supported
Chicago Community College system, which provides educational
opportunities for those who might not otherwise enter the mainstream
of American higher education. Not to be forgotten is The Newberry
Library, a research library in history and the humanities, which
attracts scholars from throughout the world to use its rich
resources, as well as genealogists interested in family history.</P>

<P>Three major medical complexes are located in the city, including
Northwestern University Medical Center and the University of Chicago
Hospitals.  The West Side Medical Center, which includes Cook County
Hospital, the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center and
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, is the largest medical
complex in the city. Loyola University Medical Center, located at
nearby suburban Maywood Park, provides yet a fourth center for
medical care in Chicagoland.</P>

<P>Chicago has a rich and diverse population, stemming from the
mid-nineteenth century when it was a principal port of entry for
immigrants from Europe. That diversity is enhanced by the migration
of African Americans from the deep South into Chicago just preceding
and following World War One. The 1990 census reports a mix that is
38.6% African American, 37.9% white, 19.6% Hispanic, and 3.6% Asian
American.  Chicago is a city of neighborhoods which in many cases
still reflect the ethnic and cultural heritage of the founding
population.</P>

<P>An unusually attractive city, of interest to architectural buffs
and tourists alike, Chicago makes claim to being home of the modern
skyscraper. Its architecture is distinctive, and reflects the
influence of such notable architects as Louis H. Sullivan, Frank
Lloyd Wright, and Mies van der Rohe, as well as the efforts of such
stalwart firms as Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, to name a few. But
perhaps the city's crown jewel is the string of park land that
stretches along the entire length of its lake front. Many of its
cultural amenities are to be found within the confines of this park,
including the small but innovative Lincoln Park Zoo.  Similar to most
major urban cities, Chicago is expending major effort and resources
on improving public education, public health service, housing and law
enforcement.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800040" SIZE="+1">St. James Cathedral</FONT></B></P>

<img src="/images/StJames.gif" width=128 height=192 alt="" align="right" border="0">
<P>St. James became the cathedral church of the Diocese of Chicago in
1955.  Formed in 1834 as St. James Church, it is the oldest Episcopal
congregation in the city of Chicago, and the mother church of the
Diocese.  Construction on the present edifice commenced in 1857, but
the tower, narthex, transepts, and apse were not completed until the
late 1860s, only to be consumed several years later in the Great
Chicago Fire in 1871. Its historic tower, the narthex, and much of
its walls survived that conflagration, and were rebuilt substantially
in its present form in 1875. In 1984, its interior was returned to
its original 1889 appearance, utilizing an intricate system of
stenciling on its ceiling, walls, and beams, which seems to enhance
the colors of its rich Victorian stained glass windows, depicting
scenes from the life of Christ. Originally designed by E .J. Neville
Stent, who was influenced by the work of William Morris, a leader in
the nineteenth century English Arts and Crafts tradition, its
interior has been described as one of the most significant Victorian
interiors in America.</P>

<P>In recent years St. James has increasingly become the liturgical
and spiritual center for the Diocese of Chicago. It is the scene of
ordinations, diocesan events and, most recently, a requiem Eucharist
for Diana, Princess of Wales. Its congregation, which is vibrant and
growing, is located in a neighborhood that is rapidly being
revitalized by the construction of new apartment buildings, several
of which are within a block or two of the church. There are three
principal services each Sunday, as well as weekday Morning and
Evening Prayer and a daily celebration of the Holy Eucharist.</P>

<P>Contiguous to the Cathedral is the modern, five-story Episcopal
Church Center, completed in 1969, which houses both cathedral and
diocesan offices. Its lower level contains Burrill Hall, a large
multipurpose meeting room, together with a kitchen and several
smaller rooms used for the Christian education program, as well as
for smaller group meetings. The office complex is also the home for
the Cathedral Counseling Center, which provides outpatient mental
health services on a sliding scale on a non-denominational basis.

<IMG SRC="/images/EpisCntr.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=210 hspace=2 vspace=2 ALIGN="left" border=0 alt="">
<P>The Diocese of Illinois was organized March 9, 1835 at its first
convention in Peoria, March 9, 1835. The three clergymen and lay
delegates chose Philander Chase, a former bishop of Ohio, as the
first bishop for Illinois.</P>

<P>A frontiersman, Chase established his seat at the new college he
founded near Peoria — Jubilee College —preferring to travel among the
remote settlements west of the Rock River, much to the detriment of
the missionary potential in newly developing urban centers, such as
at Chicago.</P>

<P>Chase died in 1852, and was succeeded by Henry John Whitehouse,
who had been elected coadjutor  one year earlier in order to assist
the aging diocesan. Endowed with a facile theological mind,
Whitehouse was strongly imbued with the spirit of the Oxford
Movement. Whitehouse’s intellectual talents and interests ranged far.
 As an ecumenist, he visited the Scandinavian and Orthodox churches
on behalf of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  He participated in the
planning process for the first Lambeth Conference, preached at its
opening service and, in recognition of his intellectual
accomplishments, received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge
universities.  At home, he was an advocate for foreign-language
congregations, especially St. Ansgarius Church, Chicago’s first
Swedish congregation, as well as French-speaking congregations at
Chicago and Kankakee.  Whitehouse took special pride in the
establishment of his Bishop’s Chapel, which was to evolve into the
Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul, the first cathedral in the American
Church.</P>

<P>Whitehouse died of apoplexy on August 10, 1874.  Unfortunately,
his death and the problem of the succession ushered in a period of
difficulty for the Diocese.  Many of those involved in the election
of a new bishop wished to continue in the High Church tradition in
which they had been nurtured by the late bishop.  Their first choice 
— James DeKoven of Racine, Wis was rejected by the General Convention
and by the church's standing committees. The diocese resolved the
impasse by electing William Edward McLaren, third bishop of Illinois,
a man against whom few could find any cause for alarm.</P>

<P>A former newspaperman, later a Presbyterian missionary to
Colombia, McLaren came to the Episcopal Church imbued by the spirit
of its sacramental theology.  He had served briefly as rector at
Trinity Church, Cleveland, the only pastoral experience he had had in
the Episcopal Church.  Undoubtedly his “Protestant” credentials
commended him to the Church at large, but he was something of an
enigma.  Initially a moderate in his theological stance, he became
increasingly an Anglo-Catholic and indeed something of a mystic. 
Seen as a strong supporter of the clergy, he did little to gain the
support of the laity, which was to </P>

<P>have disastrous consequences for the growth of the Episcopal
Church in Illinois.  However, one by-product of his administrative
and persuasive skills was the division of Illinois into three
dioceses: Quincy, Springfield, and Chicago.  McLaren took Chicago,
which because of its urban situation was seen as having the greatest
missionary potential.</P>

<P>McLaren’s last years in the Diocese were years of declining
health.  Its one bright spot was the election of Charles Palmerston
Anderson, rector of Grace Church, Oak Park, as bishop coadjutor in
1900.  Soon after that election, McLaren retired to New York. 
Anderson presided at his first convention in 1903, and upon McLaren’s
death in 1905 became diocesan.</P>

<P>The episcopate of Charles Palmerston Anderson served as an
important transition between the nineteenth century Church and the
modern Church.  The communicant strength of the Diocese expanded
dramatically, new missions were formed, and well-established
congregations expanded their facilities.  New institutions and social
agencies, such as Cathedral Shelter, Chase House, Lawrence Hall, and
Youth Guidance, were founded, and The Western Theological Seminary
moved its campus from Chicago’s West Side to Evanston.  Bishop
Anderson played a pivotal role in each of these accomplishments.  He
was also a deeply committed ecumenist, and served as Chair of the
National Church’s Faith and Order Commission.</P>

<P>Elected Presiding Bishop, Anderson assumed office in November
1929, only to succumb to a heart attack in January 1930.  He was
succeeded briefly by Sheldon Munson Griswold, formerly Bishop
Suffragan, who was himself in poor health.  Griswold accepted
election as diocesan, February 5, 1930, but immediately called for
the election of coadjutor from his hospital bed.  That special
convention elected George Craig Stewart bishop coadjutor.  Shortly
after Stewart’s consecration, Griswold died at Evanston, November 28,
1930.</P>

<P>At the time of his election, George Craig Stewart was already one
of America’s great church leaders.  A profound and moving preacher,
sound scholar, and beloved pastor, he brought an intense spirit of
vitality to everything he touched.  He brought great promise to his
new role of bishop; unfortunately, his episcopate coincided with the
era of the economic depression of the 1930s.</P>

<P>The Great Depression had grave financial consequences for the
Diocese of Chicago, which soon found itself in near bankruptcy
because of an ill-conceived investment in an apartment house venture,
the purchase of the present diocesan center site, and obligations for
assisting new mission churches. </P>

<P>Self-supporting congregations had similar financial problems. 
They too had constructed expensive edifices -- new churches, parish
house facilities, and rectories.  Their cumulative debt was still
another million dollars, so that at the time Bishop Stewart assumed
office, the Diocese faced a total indebtedness of $2 million.  This
crushing financial burden exacted its toll.  Throughout the 1930s,
Stewart struggled to regain financial solvency, but in the end his
health was broken.  He died from a heart attack while making an
episcopal visitation on Chicago’s South Side, May 2, 1940.</P>

<P>Wallace Edmonds Conkling, rector of St. Luke’s Church,
Philadelphia, was elected seventh bishop of Chicago, November 28,
1940.  A leader in the Anglo-Catholic movement, he gained prominence
at the 1943 General Convention in his role as leader in the movement
that opposed the proposals for unity with the Presbyterian Church.  A
capable administrator, he quickly retired the Diocese’s indebtedness,
and put its financial house in order.  He also laid the groundwork
for the expansion of the Church into the rapidly expanding suburbs, a
work that was continued by his successor in office, Gerald Francis
Burrill.</P>

<P>Perhaps the liturgical highlight of the early years of the Burrill
episcopate was the Catholic Congress held in Chicago almost
immediately following his election as bishop in 1954.  But it was
also an era of immense social change, not the least of which was the
civil rights movement.  Burrill and Bishop Suffragan James Winchester
Montgomery played a decisive role in that struggle, successfully
bringing Mayor Richard J. Daley and Martin Luther King, Jr., to the
bargaining table on the issue of open housing.  Those deliberations
were held at the former diocesan headquarters building on Huron
Street.</P>

<P>Bishop Burrill continued the expansion of the Church into the
suburbs that had begun under his predecessor, but perhaps the
culmination of the Burrill years was the construction of a new
headquarters building, the Episcopal Church Center, in 1969.  Burrill
retired two years later and was succeeded by Bishop Montgomery, who
had been elected coadjutor in 1965.</P>

<P>Montgomery was an immensely popular church leader, both locally
and nationally.  But these were difficult years.  Prayer Book
revision, in which Montgomery had played a decisive role, was
controversial; but perhaps more controversial was the issue of the
ordination of women to the priesthood.  Montgomery had voted against
the ordination of women on the ecumenical ground that it was a
decision that should be made by all branches of the catholic church. 
For this reason, he personally deferred from ordaining women to the
priesthood, but had encouraged Bishop Suffragan Quintin E. Primo,
Jr., to do so in his stead.  He was, however, a great reconciler, the
result of which was that few priests left the church.  Furthermore,
there were no break-away congregations within the diocese during his
episcopate.  An effective fund-raiser, Montgomery had provided
enormous energy for such projects as Venture in Mission and the
restoration of St. James Cathedral.  He retired from office in
October, 1987, and was succeeded by Bishop Coadjutor Frank Tracy
Griswold III.</P>

<P>Upon assuming office, Griswold quickly became a leader in the
progressive wing of the Anglo-Catholic movement.  A staunch supporter
of the ordination of women to the priesthood, he actively sought
their deployment, with the result that by the end of his episcopate,
eight women served as vicars of mission congregations, five as
rectors of parishes.  Perhaps more controversial, however, had been
his role as advocate for the ordination of gays and lesbians to the
diaconate and priesthood.  A supporter of the diaconate program, he
restored the ancient office of archdeacon to its original dignity,
thereby making that office responsible for the coordination of the
diaconate program within the diocese.</P>

<P>On the national level, Griswold played a decisive role in
ecumenical matters, serving as chair of the Anglican-Roman Catholic
International Consultation.  On its behalf, he visited the Vatican on
two occasions: the first, a private audience with Pope John Paul II;
the second on a pilgrimage with a delegation of Episcopal and
Catholic bishops, with stops at Canterbury and Rome.  Griswold was
elected twenty-fifth Presiding Bishop and Primate of the American
Episcopal Church, and was invested with the symbols of office during
a solemn liturgy at the National Cathedral, January 10, 1998.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800040" SIZE="+1">Today: A Large and Diverse Diocese</FONT></B></P>

<img src="/images/CampBoys.jpg" align=right width=200 height=203 alt="" border="0">
<P>Chicago ranks among the twelve largest dioceses in the country. 
There are 137 congregations, of which 36 are missions.  However, in
parallel with declining national memberships, the Chicago diocese has
seen a decline in membership:  47,171 baptized members in 1994, but
only 42,667 souls in 1996. Corresponding figures for confirmed
communicants are equally disheartening, with 33,622 communicants in
1991, but only 28,093 in 1996. Clearly these are issues that must be
addressed.</P>

<P>The Diocese is rich in its ethnic and racial diversity.  There are
four Hispanic congregations, one of which is located in the near
western suburbs.  In addition, four congregations outside Chicago
provide Spanish language services, and two others  share their
facilities with congregations of the Philippine Independent Church. 
There is one Korean American  congregation, and the Diocese is
blessed with eight African-American congregations, one of which has
an affordable housing program that has received national attention. 
</P>

<a name="Sec5">
<P><B>A Diocese Dependent On Voluntary Giving</B></P>

<P>The Diocese of Chicago has little endowment income, perhaps one of
the lowest in the Episcopal Church. Discretionary funds at the
disposal of its bishop have been adequate, but never ample enough for
the inauguration of new work.  In 1995, at which time a mandatory
form of apportionment was replaced by one that was voluntary.
Diocesan income in that year dropped $800,000 -- from $3,618,00 in
fiscal 1994 to $2,816,00 in fiscal 1995. At the same time the Diocese
decreased its pledge to the national church by slightly less than
$400,000. These cuts had a corresponding effect on program with the
elimination of $100,000 for the Ministry Development Office, $100,000
for mission support, and $100,000 in various social justice
ministries.</P>

<P>In 1994, an annual diocesan visitation program was established by
which lay and clergy leaders make contact with each congregation,
seeking to increase their pledge for the diocesan program.  The
program has not produced new income, but it has increased a sense of
freedom and generosity as well as facilitating communication.  Many
congregations have taken this opportunity to support local social
ministries in lieu of increasing support of the Diocese.</P>

<a name="Sec6">
<P><B>Missions and Aided Congregations</B></P>

<P>Recently, there have been major changes in our approach to and
success with congregational development.  In the last five years, the
amount of diocesan mission support has been reduced by fifty percent
or more in nineteen of the missions.  This has allowed monies to be
invested in developing Hispanic congregations as well as
congregations located in developing suburbs.  In the last eight
years, six missions have been closed or been consolidated with other
congregations, one has achieved parish status, one was ceded to the
Diocese of Quincy, and seven have become self-supporting.  Former
parishioners of these closed missions have greatly strengthened
neighboring parishes and missions where they have been warmly
welcomed. </P>

<P>It is expected that within the next five years seven former
missions will be able to petition for parish status.  It is also
expected that the use of clustering techniques and non-stipendiary
priests will allow a number of missions to become self supporting. 
</P>

<P>The facilities of two former mission congregations have been
turned over to Hispanic congregations: St. Patrick, Franklin Park, to
El Espiritu Santo (the former San Pedro, Chicago), and St. Francis to
El Cristo Rey. The results for El Espiritu Santo have been salutary
with a considerable increase in congregants -- almost doubling church
attendance in the six months of its existence at Franklin Park. The
church edifice, admittedly small, is already filled to capacity, and 
the members are talking about expanding its facilities.  El Cristo
Rey, on the other hand, has only just moved into its new facilities,
and it is at present too soon to report on any progress at that
mission.</P>

<P>The Church of One in Christ, a Korean American congregation that
shares facilities with the former St. Anselm Church, Park Ridge, has
also met with some success. The congregation was for a period of time
served by an American priest who learned Korean as a second language.
Presently, the congregation is served by a priest from the Anglican
Church of Korea.</P>

<a name="Sec7">
<P><B>New Congregations</B></P>

<P>For a number of years the Diocesan vision has included the
possibility of beginning new work in the Fox River Valley, an area
that is enjoying a considerable population expansion. Those plans
were thwarted, but a more recent vision includes the possibility of
opening a new church in the vicinity of Orland Park, located in
Chicago’s south suburbs. The Diocese has purchased five acres in that
area, and has set aside $100,000 for each of the next three years.
The Frank T. Griswold Fund for Congregational Development has
recently been established to underwrite the cost of new
congregations. It is hoped that the appointment of a new mission
supervisor will provide the impetus to inaugurate additional new
congregations.</P>

<P>A survey of the people of the Diocese of Chicago was administered
on two successive Sundays in late January.  Many questionnaires were
answered at coffee hours following the principal Sunday service or at
the congregation's annual meeting.  The response was encouraging: 93%
of congregations participated, with 6,520 respondents from a diocese
with a communicant strength of 42,667 baptized members, including
28,093 confirmed communicants.  In a second survey, clergy were
provided an opportunity to address their own particular concerns, and
in a third survey, congregations were provided the same opportunity
as the clergy.  From the questionnaires, consensus emerged on several
issues that have been laid before God's people in the Episcopal
Diocese of Chicago.</P>

<P>Based on the surveys and on  conversations within the Search and
Nominating Committee, these are some of the hopes, expectations, and
issues we think we face:</P>
