<p>Dean Persell has served as dean of Trinity Cathedral in Cleveland since 1991, during which time attendance and giving have more than doubled, cathedral programs have increased, and relationships with the rest of diocese have grown stronger. Before accepting the call to Trinity, he served nine years at St. Ann's and Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, N.Y. where he encouraged parish involvement in ecumenical and interfaith work, and helped establish the St. Ann's Center for Restoration and the Arts. </p>

<p>His ministry had its start on the West Coast where he served four years as assistant and associate rector of St. Paul's, Tustin; and then for ten years as associate and rector of St. John's, Los Angeles. At St. Paul's in Orange County he organized a parish peace group,  and set up an urban ministry training program for suburban church members. While at St. John's he expanded the social services ministry and helped organize the first Integrity chapter for supporting gay and lesbian church members in the Diocese of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In the Diocese of Ohio, Dean Persell serves on the Ecclesiastical Court, the Personnel Committee, the Episcopal Community Services Foundation, and on the Peace and Justice Commission. In addition he is a member of the Episcopal Peace Fellowship and Integrity. His community involvement includes United Pastors in Mission, Area Business-Clergy Dialogue, Partners for Sacred Places, YMCA of Greater Cleveland and Westside-Eastside Congregations Acting Now.</p>
