<b><li>How would you encourage/nourish the participation of children and young adults in the church?</b></font><br><br>
<p>I have observed that the level of participation of children and youth at the (Baltimore) Cathedral is in direct proportion to the resources - human and financial - dedicated to these ministries.  These resources are both those of the Cathedral congregation and of the diocese.  Among other steps, the Cathedral called a priest whose primary ministries are with children and youth.  The diocese has called a Missioner for Christian Education, and increased emphasis has been given to our camp and conference center.</p>

<p>In my experience as a young parish assistant, part of my work focused on developing programs for young adults.  We attracted and held a goodly number of young adults, some who later were elected to the Vestry.  It is the same principle of making something a priority and giving it appropriate and sufficient resources to thrive.</p>

<p>Developing programs geared to the needs and concerns of the intended population is key.  Equally, developing a community atmosphere is essential, one that supports by word and deed the incorporation of new ideas, new ways of doing things, and especially new people.</p>

<p>In this vein, I have heard Tex Sample, a Methodist seminary professor speak about evangelizing the next generations.  He speaks at length and demonstrates how they are "wired" differently than us.  He illustrates by using the different rhythms of our music.  Sample challenges us with questions of how much we are willing to change how we present the Gospel in order to attract and hold the next generations.</p>

<p>I would encourage the diocesan community to carefully reflect on this question, and to be bold enough to try new approaches; to be resilient enough to permit failures; and to be hospitable enough not only to offer the Gospel in ways new generations can hear but also to receive their gifts and insights.</p>

<b><li>What risks have you taken for the Gospel?</b></font><br><br>
<p>One example is "taking a stand," like my decision to register for the draft as a conscientious objector.  In examining my options, I ran into the phrase, "opposed to participation in war in any form, based on religious beliefs and training."  The more I thought about this, the more I realized it fit.  Immaturely articulated, I had a strong sense that my life was about building bridges and reconciliation.  I learned that no matter how sincerely held, how agonizingly arrived at, or how clearly it seems to be tied to the Gospel, taking a stand can and does cost friendships and community support.</p>

<p>Truth telling is risk taking.  For example, I was asked by a rector and vestry to intervene in their particularly nasty conflict.  After many meetings with the rector, wardens and vestry, separately and together, it became clear that while there was plenty of fault all around, the rector was his own worst enemy.  When it came time to report and to make recommendations, I shared specific feedback that the vestry found difficult.  They were willing to reflect on it and to accept responsibility.  I did the same with the rector.  His response was to deny and to withdraw into himself.  The meeting ended without resolution.  Weeks later, the rector phoned.  I drove out for a meeting, which consisted of an angry monologue about my incompetence and lack of caring.</p>

<p>The coincidence of the second Sunday of Advent and Pearl Harbor Day has led me to preach about preparing for the coming of the Lord and our common call to the ministry of reconciliation.  It is a risk because these are difficult words to hear for some veterans, some families of Pacific theater combatants, and particularly families of Pearl Harbor victims.  Some hear a call to forget and confront me as if I was responsible for their pain.  On the other hand, I have been thanked for pointing to the only One who reconciles us all.</p>

<b><li>As you know, the Diocese of Chicago moved from an assessment giving to voluntary giving.  Tell us about how your theology of stewardship might have an impact in the Diocese of Chicago.</b></font><br><br>
<p>Stewardship is a matter of the conversion of the heart.  Stewardship is a response to our relationship with God, and an expression of our appreciation for all that God is and does for us.  So, stewardship is an act of thanksgiving.  Therefore, I believe any discussion about Christian giving must be in voluntary terms.  I do not believe in coercion, sales jobs, or guilt trips.  My experience and observation are that giving time, talent, and treasure all increase as the relationship with God deepens and the discernment of God's activity in our lives becomes clearer.</p>

<p>Having said this, I believe it is desirable for the church to set standards for giving.  We accept this in other areas.  The Book of Common Prayer by its structure suggests a standard of daily prayer.  The catechism calls us "together week by week for corporate worship."  Thus, I advocate and practice the tithe as the minimum standard for giving.  I believe it is appropriate to challenge congregations to meet the General Convention standard of using 50% of their budgets for ministry beyond themselves.</p>

<p>Stewardship is also about the wise usage of resources for the mission of the Church.  It is essential for congregations and dioceses to be transparent about their resources, the use of such resources, and how these usages are related to carrying out the mission of the Church.</p>

<p>I would want my theology of stewardship to have the following impact: I would want to challenge the current "voluntary giving" to become "voluntary giving with standards;" I would like to build in mutual accountability; and, I would seek a task force of people from diverse congregations to propose the standards and to propose how mutual accountability might be fostered.</p>

<b><li>The Diocese of Chicago, as you may have gathered, is a diverse place in many ways: geographically, socioeconomically, ethnically, liturgically (high church/low church/broad church, etc.).  How would you envision fostering a sense of unity and belonging across the diocese?</b></font><br><br>
<p>I would envision devoting a lot of time to building relationships with clergy, lay leaders and their communities.  Building relationships is essential so clergy, lay leaders and their bishop can believe and act on the belief they are partners in Christ's mission and ministry in the world.  The catechism is clear that all people share in Christ's ministry.  But this verity is not worth much until relationships of trust exist.  Trusting relationships are essential to negotiate clear understandings about what can be expected of one another in terms of such things as communication, provision of resources, ways to challenge one another, spiritual support, and decision-making.</p>

<p>Second, I would envision creating opportunities for dialogue and sharing among clergy and lay leaders.  Healing will require the leadership of the Bishop, but it will also require more and more people to accept their leadership responsibilities, and for more and more to engage in the hard work of reconciliation.  While the Bishop must, under all circumstances, stay in touch with all parts of the diocese, I believe the Bishop's energies are best used in relationship to those parts that are healthy or working to become healthy.</p>

<p>Third, I would envision a process that would engage as many "shareholders" as possible in formulating a diocesan mission vision and redeveloping a diocesan structure for carrying out that vision.  I would ask the process to model partnerships amongst clergy, lay leaders and bishop.  I would seek a process that takes into account people who are not yet in our pews.  I would encourage a consensus building process rather than a political process with its inevitable winners and losers.</p>
