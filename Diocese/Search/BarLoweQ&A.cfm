<b><li>How would you encourage/nourish the participation of children and young adults in the church?</b></font><br><br>
<p>An enduring characteristic of my ordained ministry has been a strong commitment to the Church's nurture and encouragement of children, youth and young adults.  The practical side of this commitment has led me to a continuing, personal involvement with the Church's younger members: throughout my priesthood I have taught Sunday School classes, led Youth trips, spent countless happy hours in conversation, and learned firsthand the challenges, hopes and dreams of young people. Furthermore, as a person who rediscovered the Church as a young adult and who has mentored others of such an age, I see ministry with and to young adults as a priority, especially during their college and early working years.</p>

<p>The Church needs our young people, and not only to assist them in their formation.  As the pace of change accelerates, they are often the first among us to understand the new environment in which the Church is called to minister.  Our young people can expand our vision, stir our imaginations, and foster the enthusiasm and excitement that should shine throughout our ministry.</p>

<p>Young people ought be regarded as who they are: full members of the Church, through their baptism.  Childhood, adolescence and young adulthood are times for education, exploration, and unleashing creativity and talents.  The Church should be a safe, hospitable place for such activities, and offer support to those responsible for their training and nurture.</p>

<p>As Bishop, I would encourage the full participation of children and young people in the Church by being present in their lives: seeking their presence, listening to their aspirations, and understanding their parents' concerns.  I would promote quality, comprehensive Christian education for our children and youth, and an open, welcoming Church for young adults.  I would also continue my leadership in the public arena, advocating for the needs of children, youth and their families.</p>

<b><li>What risks have you taken for the Gospel?</b></font><br><br>
<p>Risk-taking requires both an element of chance and an appreciation of the value of what might be gained or lost.  So, in a sense, allying oneself with the Gospel is never a risk; since Christians profess the incomparable value of the Good News, if we agree with the Gospel authors that Jesus is with us always (Matthew 28:20) and provides what we need when tested (Mark 13:11), in the long run the Gospel will overcome all obstacles.  Nonetheless, I do know something of risking comfort, security or desire to follow where the Good News of Jesus leads.</p>

<p>In retrospect, some of these risks seem more for myself than for the Gospel, for I've discovered that society often expects clergy to have particular opinions or attitudes.  So, for example, I risk less by being against the death penalty than a laywoman who expresses her opposition during a coffee break at work.  I can be dismissed as a "preacher;" she has to face the possibility of a newly-hostile workplace.</p>

<p>Most of the risks I have taken for the Gospel have been relational, such as when I refused to withdraw from community outreach ministries despite vicious attacks; or the time I ignored critics and celebrated the marriage of an interracial couple; or when I withstood threats for refusing to censure parishioners because of their sexual orientation.</p>

<p>At such times I am willing to take risks because of my pastoral care for the people with whom I stand, and because of my relationship with Jesus Christ.  In taking such risks, I have acted from my belief in God's unconditional love for all people, and God's presence with us when we demonstrate such love.  For me, the courage and faith to risk has come through the Church, as my sisters and brothers have shared their joy in following Jesus, whatever the apparent cost.</p>

<b><li>As you know, the Diocese of Chicago moved from an assessment giving to voluntary giving.  Tell us about how your theology of stewardship might have an impact in the Diocese of Chicago.</b></font><br><br>
<p>I am convinced that a theology of stewardship that calls for joyous giving to God from the abundance of God's gifts to us is the appropriate one for the Church.  "All things come of Thee, O Lord, and of Thine Own have we given Thee"; this "theology of abundance" undergirds my stewardship teaching, and is a continuing guide in ordering my life.  Given this, tithing (which I wholeheartedly endorse) seems a reasonable approach to our personal stewardship.</p>

<p>With the advent of voluntary giving, the importance of such personal stewardship is magnified; if everyone in the Church were tithing, there would be ample resources for congregational, Diocesan and other needs.  But while we work toward such an ideal, the best approach to balancing the needs of local communities and broader Diocesan work might be a re-imagining of Diocesan ministry.</p>

<p>To begin, we might agree that congregational and diocesan planning ought be in harmony; what is God calling us to be and do in the Diocese of Chicago, and who should do it?  In answering that, we ought be open to creative solutions, unusual alliances, and inventive patterns of ministry.</p>

<p>A theology of abundance says we have the resources we need to accomplish God's will; we simply need to identify them and be faithful in their use.  A Diocesan approach that respects voluntary giving, believes in common planning, is open to the Spirit's "doing a new thing," and which lives this theology would not think in boxes; it would start from a "can do" perspective, and continue with faithful commitment.</p>

<p>From God's abundance, I can envision dozens of new church-starts throughout the Diocese; teams of priests, deacons and laity in shared area ministry; strategic alliances among congregations and with ecumenical partners; and growing initiatives in social ministry and advocacy -- if we have a vision of who we are and where we are going.</p>

<font face="Tahoma" color=navy size="-1">
<b><li>The Diocese of Chicago, as you may have gathered, is a diverse place in many ways: geographically, socioeconomically, ethnically, liturgically (high church/low church/broad church, etc.).  How would you envision fostering a sense of unity and belonging across the diocese?</b></font><br><br>
<p>As Bishop, I would act upon my belief that each diverse gift strengthens the whole Church and thereby promotes unity.  For as corporations, portfolio managers, farmers and many others know, diversification mitigates against unforeseen dangers, and helps ensure success.  Diversity most accurately reflects the Creation; a Church that appreciates such gifts as race, gender, or age will be a better agent of the Gospel.</p>

<p>I relish the energy inherent in diversity, believing with Paul that "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good" (I Corinthians 12:7).  As Bishop, I would eagerly promote cross-fertilization of ideas, background and experience, and expose prejudice that keeps us from these benefits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would marshal this energy toward a common vision that appreciates the variety within our field of mission -- one which asks, "Where is God leading us?  What are the characteristics and needs of our communities?  How can we enlist the resources and energy available throughout the Diocese to do the work and ministry to which we are called?"</p>

<p>I have ministered in urban, suburban and rural areas, and know that congregations are the front lines of ministry, contending daily with conflicting expectations and demands on the Church's mission.  Our clergy and lay people show outstanding leadership in straddling many worlds, and deserve no less than imaginative, inspired guidance from their Bishop.  Clergy need their Bishop's pastoral care and personal encouragement; laypeople deserve their Bishop's keen interest in their lives and work.  Such episcopal commitment is essential for maintaining unity amidst diversity.</p>

<p>Therefore, as Bishop I would be an active, available pastor to the clergy and an empathetic champion of the laity.  I would promote Diocesan unity by striving to be collegial leader, a minister of reconciliation, and a common link among the extraordinary diversity of the Diocese.</p>
