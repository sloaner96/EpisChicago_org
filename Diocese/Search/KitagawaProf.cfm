<p>Canon Kitagawa has served on the staff of the Diocese of Maryland since 1984. After four years as canon for mission development, he was appointed executive officer and canon for congregational development. In 1995 he was named canon to the ordinary. His responsibilities have included designing and implementing  congregational development and revitalization programs; providing pastoral care to clergy and clergy families; supporting and developing men and women for lay and ordained ministries; coordinating diocesan administration; working as an advocate for social justice; and teaching and preaching at congregational and diocesan levels. His experience in policy development includes clarifying procedures for congregations moving from mission to parish status; developing new methodology for financially supporting small congregations and for developing new congregations; and clarifying the ecclesiastical disciplinary procedures under the new Title IV canons. He has a strong interest in communications, having led the formation of a diocesan communications task force.</p>

<p>His first call as priest was as assistant at three New York City parishes-Calvary Church, Holy Communion and St. George's  in Manhattan. Two years later he was called to serve as coordinator of the Downtown Cooperative Ministry in New Haven, Conn. </p>

<p>At the church's national level he has served as deputy to three General Conventions (1991, 1994, 1997); and as a member of the Standing Commission on Ecumenical Relations, and the Standing Commission on World Mission. He currently chairs the Standing Commission on the Structure of the Church and serves on the Board of Archives, and on the General Board of the National Council of the Churches of Christ. He served as a delegate to the 1975 World Council of Churches assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, and since then has represented the church on numerous international delegations.</p>

<p>Canon Kitagawa helped establish the Columbus House Shelter and the Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers program for the homebound in New Haven, Conn., and chaired the Board of Interfaith Action for Racial Justice in Baltimore. He is currently active in Habitat for Humanity.</p>
