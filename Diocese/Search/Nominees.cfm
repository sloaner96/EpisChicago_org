<p>The <a href="Roster.cfm">Search and Nominating Committee</a> (SNC) is pleased to present five nominees for Bishop of Chicago to be elected on November 14, 1998. Our committee of twenty-nine persons represented all deaneries and reflected the multi-faceted diversity of our diocese. Members brought experience of varying liturgical traditions and a history of commitment to a wide variety of ministries important to our common life in the Diocese of Chicago. We undertook our assignment prayerfully.</p>

<p>Following analysis of the survey administered throughout the Diocese, and the preparation and publication of a <a href="DioProfile.cfm">Diocesan Profile</a>, an invitation to submit names of persons who might be suitable to enter the process of discernment was sent to bishops, priests canonically resident in Chicago, and seminary deans. Through Anglican Advance and church bulletins, lay communicants of the diocese were encouraged to make recommendations.   Notices were placed in Episcopal publications, and we asked that the Church Deployment Office search for appropriate candidates for this position, giving special emphasis to the identification of minority and women clergy.</p>

<p>We received 119 names of individuals, representing a diverse group of clergy, each of whom was invited to participate in the process. Fifty-four accepted our invitation. In addition, 33 other clergy were recommended by the Church Deployment Office. Of these 87 individuals, 33 were selected to continue in the process. Twenty-three accepted our invitation. Discernment over several meetings, including a retreat weekend, led us eventually to eleven semi-finalists, who were visited in their parishes by three-member teams of the SNC, and to six semi-finalists, who met with the entire committee prior to the selection of the five nominees presented to you today.</p>

<p>We sincerely believe that the discernment process was conducted fairly, with care, thoughtfulness, and prayer. As a committee, we feel that we have been truly guided by the Holy Spirit during these months and will continue to be so guided as we complete arrangements for hosting the nominees' visits to Chicago October 22 - 25 <font size="-1">(see <a href="Schedule.cfm">timeline</a>)</font>.</p>

<p>With confidence in the guidance of God's spirit, we present these nominees to you for your further discernment and for the election on November 14 of the XI Bishop of Chicago.
