<b><li>How would you encourage/nourish the participation of children and young adults in the church?</b></font><br><br>
<p>From my days growing up in a small town church to the present, ministry to and with youth has been vitally important to me.  In all the parishes I have served we have greatly increased the participation of children and young adults, primarily by focusing attention and resources.</p>

<p>At Trinity Cathedral we've grown from five children in a one class Sunday School to over sixty children.  I brought parents together and asked what they wanted done to develop our church school and to improve our nursery care.  They became part of the process and we set up a staffed and budgeted Christian Education Committee.</p>

<p>This summer the Cathedral paid to send our youth to camp, participated in an intergenerational event with the Art Museum, sponsored an original theater production written and performed by neighborhood youth, hosted youth who built a Habitat House, and instituted an additional weekly family Eucharist.</p>

<p>I strongly support diocesan youth and campus ministries.  As Bishop I would actively participate in and advocate for them.</p>

<p>In the future we must be open to new ways of ministering across parish and ecumenical lines and on the Internet, where increasing numbers of youth spend time.</p>

<p>The Church must also be an advocate for children, too many of whom live in poverty.  Youth boredom, drug abuse, and violence know no boundaries.  Our juvenile justice systems are failing.  Homeless shelters are no substitute for homes.</p>

<p>Aldous Huxley once wrote that "children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardour, for their curiosity, their intolerance of shams, the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision."  Yes!  and how we need these qualities in the Church.</p>

<p>Jesus welcomed children and pointed to their faith as exemplary of life under the reign of God.  Encouraging the participation of children, teenagers and young adults in the Church must be a high priority.  It is one of mine.</p>

<font face="Tahoma" color=navy size="-1">
<b><li>What risks have you taken for the Gospel?</b></font><br><br>
<p>Risks I have taken for the Gospel have provided the experiences that have increased my faith and enriched my life.</p>

<p>As a seminarian assigned to an inner-city Black parish, I worked with teenage boys from near-by projects.  That year put me in several life-threatening situations and in the middle of conflicts with parishioners who were opposed to this ministry.  I learned much, including a commitment to the Church's urban ministry and a respect for people's survival skills.</p>

<p>In Orange County, I started a parish peace group.  This was controversial, but we worked to keep those who disagreed involved in the parish, as we struggled to end the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>In Los Angeles, my parish hosted the first Integrity Chapter in the Diocese.  Throughout my ministry I have been supportive of the rights of gays and lesbians and am thankful for their faithful participation in the Church. </p>

<p>In Brooklyn, in order for the parish to minister in its beautiful, but crumbling, landmark building, we needed outside support.  We set up a structure in which government, corporations, foundations and individuals could contribute and have a voice.  We risked some control and found exciting new ways to be the Church.</p>

<p>At Trinity Cathedral we've replaced fixed pews with chairs, allowing flexibility and new uses, including diocesan conventions, festivals, banquets, concerts and labyrinth walks.  People of many faiths come to the Cathedral.  Some see this inclusiveness as a threat to our Episcopal and Christian identity.  Most see an exciting opportunity to share the love of Christ in different ways with new people.</p>

<p>To be faithful followers of Jesus Christ, the next Bishop and the people of the Diocese will need to take risks together.  Doing so for the Gospel requires prayer, discernment, consultation, and a strong confidence in God's presence, guidance and love.</p>

<b><li>As you know, the Diocese of Chicago moved from an assessment giving to voluntary giving.  Tell us about how your theology of stewardship might have an impact in the Diocese of Chicago.</b></font><br><br>
<p>To paraphrase St. Paul, "...neither assessment giving nor voluntary giving counts for anything; the onlything that counts is faith working through love."  To deal with the funding crisis of the Episcopal Church, will mean not tinkering with apportionments and giving formulae, but with Bible study, theological reflection, and renewal.  As we understand and are committed to the Church's mission, the money and other resources will flow.  I firmly believe this.  Often a lack of imagination, faith and courage, not money, inhibits our mission.  In all parishes I have served, giving increased dramatically, through education, honest sharing about mission and resources, and through careful spending and full accountability.  The Cathedral's pledge income has increased 80% over the past seven years.</p>

<p>The creation, the natural and social orders, the Church and our lives belong to God who intrusts them to our care.  Stewardship concerns living in ways that promote the health of our planet, ways that are faithful to God's intentions for us. Part of stewardship is our growth as thankful, generous people who give to support the life and mission of the Church.</p>

<p>My wife and I practice the discipline of tithing, giving more than ten percent of our income to the Church, cultural and educational institutions and to charities.  Congregations I've served have always placed giving our fair share to the Diocese, National and World Mission of the Church first, regardless of the formula.  We have also supported special offerings and mission projects, including building a church in Uganda.</p>

<p>I would expect parishes to support the mission of the Diocese as they understand and participate in it.  We are responsible to one another for our common life.  Whatever the system, our giving should flow as a joyful and thankful response to God, who richly blesses us.</p>

<b><li>The Diocese of Chicago, as you may have gathered, is a diverse place in many ways: geographically, socioeconomically, ethnically, liturgically (high church/low church/broad church, etc.).  How would you envision fostering a sense of unity and belonging across the diocese?</b></font><br><br>
<p>The unity and sense of belonging which we seek in the Diocese of Chicago is grounded in our life in Jesus Christ.  The Diocese's diversity is something to be celebrated within this context.  We will never all agree on issues or on liturgical or other matters.  Our different experiences and views provide a rich tapestry which, when all are included, bears a more faithful and authentic representation of Christ to the world.</p>

<p>The Diocese must live in ways which recognize this truth.  Gatherings must celebrate our differences and seek to build mutual understanding, love and respect.  We need to appreciate  the history and current reality of Anglicanism.  We are a diverse people called to oneness in Jesus Christ, not to be the same, but to be united in fellowship, worship and mission.  This means we must overcome racism and all else that denies our unity.</p>

<p>The Bishop must be a faithful person who relates well to poor and rich, conservatives and liberals, and to those on either side of other dividing lines.  One of the joys the Bishop will have is to minister and worship with a rich variety of congregations. </p>

<p>Welcoming and including a diverse membership is an ongoing challenge.  I worked for the ordination of women as priests and my ministry has been strengthened with them on my staffs.</p>

<p>In Los Angeles I encouraged Asian and Hispanic ministries and was Vice-President of an ecumenical organization of three hundred African-American clergy.  In Cleveland I am a member of an African-American clergy association with some Anglo members.  I am comfortable in all kinds of congregations and situations, thriving on diversity.</p>

<p>A sense of unity and belonging should be fostered by presence, accessibility, genuine interest in people, skillful use of media, education, good humor and fun, and the encouragement of prayer and mutual support for one another.</p>
