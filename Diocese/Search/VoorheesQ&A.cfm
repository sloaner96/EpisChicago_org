<b><li>How would you encourage/nourish the participation of children and young adults in the church?</b></font><br><br>
<p>In the Episcopal Church's "Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage" we pray for the couple: "Give them wisdom and devotion in the ordering of their common life, that each may be to the other a strength in need, a counselor in perplexity, a comfort in sorrow, and a companion in joy." (BCP p. 429)  This prayer has been foundational for me in many relationships.  I believe it is the Church's role to offer no less to our children, youth, and young adults. </p>

<p>In an increasingly confusing world with dramatically competing values the Church must provide more than just simple answers to its upcoming generations of spiritual seekers.  If our children are to develop a sincere and grounded faith then we must encourage their questions and give them the tools and resources they need to become confident individuals capable of making mature choices.  To do this the Church must offer a safe environment that supports each child's emotional, intellectual, and spiritual growth.  It means that those who teach and guide them must learn to speak their language, meet them on their ground, provide proper nourishment for their growth, and bless them on their journeys.  Additionally, if the Church is to be attractive to future generations it must celebrate their gifts, embrace them as full participants in the community, and welcome them at the table.</p>

<p>At his baptism, Jesus heard a voice from heaven proclaim, "You are my son, the beloved, with whom I am well pleased."  We, who are the community of faith gathered in the covenant of that baptism, are called to "respect the dignity of every human being."  This is especially true for our children, youth and young adults who need to hear, experience, and never doubt that they are "beloved" children of God.</p>

<b><li>What risks have you taken for the Gospel?</b></font><br><br>
<p>"If you accept the call to St. Mark's, Toledo you can either maintain the status quo until they close the doors or accept the risk and challenge of leading the congregation into new life."  These were the words of my bishop nine years ago.  The parish was "celebrating" its centennial after decades of decline and eight years of conflict.  Sunday attendance had dwindled to 40 tired and dispirited souls.  There were two families with children, no programs, and visitors admitted they were afraid to venture into our crime-ridden neighborhood.  Moreover, the church was in sad disrepair after 30 years of deferred maintenance.</p>

<p>Unsure of what the outcome might be, I chose to risk leading a process.  Faced with spending nearly $500,000 for renovations, I challenged the congregation to envision its future.  "Should we move, merge, shut the doors, or risk reinventing ministry for St. Mark's?" I asked.  As the cost and promise of each option was measured over the next 18 months, I experienced skepticism from many and downright hostility from a few.  Yet, with the Gospel at our center, I garnered a supportive base that with bold faith and unabashed trepidation began to explore a unique identity as a Christian community in Toledo.</p>

<p>In the years that followed we invited the marginalized to enter our doors. We purchased adjoining real estate and began housing the homeless.  We provided a safe place for the minds, bodies, and spirits of 30 diverse community groups.  We offered ministry and solace to those dying of AIDS.  Not surprisingly, some parishioners left.  However, most embraced our new life and newcomers have swelled our ranks.</p>

<p>It was a tenuous and trying time, yet today "taking risks for the sake of the Gospel" has become a norm at St. Mark's that continues to strengthen my faith and the faith of the entire community.</p>

<b><li>As you know, the Diocese of Chicago moved from an assessment giving to voluntary giving.  Tell us about how your theology of stewardship might have an impact in the Diocese of Chicago.</b></font><br><br>
<p>I believe stewardship is about faith, not merely funding budgets; about a process, not an outcome. Our Catechism defines a sacrament as the "outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace  "  (BCP p. 857)  Stewardship is one of the "outward and visible signs" of the "inward and spiritual grace" that is known in a mature faith.  When a person's faith journey is fortified by a process of education, prayer, and reflection then faithful stewardship flows as a natural consequence.  When one's spirituality becomes connected to the rest of their life then they willingly share what, for them, has heart, meaning, and, ultimately, value.  When people believe they are living in "abundance" rather than "scarcity" they give their gifts, no matter how large or small, from a place of joy not resentment; out of sincere generosity not obligation.</p>

<p>Clearly, funding the mission and ministry of the Diocese is an issue of stewardship.  On the one hand, asking congregations to support of the work of the Diocese by means of an apportionment, quota, or assessment can distribute the financial responsibility fairly and establish a safe foundation for an annual budget.  However, I believe that this form of giving is disconnected from the spiritual experience of the "person in the pew," and, as such, undermines the core values of our faith.</p>

<p>On the other hand, supporting the Diocese through a process of voluntary giving upholds the values of our faith.  However, it can only be successful if there is a focus on spiritual development and growth, open communication that encourages "ownership," and a shared engagement in a common vision.  Voluntary giving is not a "quick fix."  Nevertheless, I believe it is a process that can authenticate our faith and lead the people of the Diocese towards abundance.</p>

<b><li>The Diocese of Chicago, as you may have gathered, is a diverse place in many ways: geographically, socioeconomically, ethnically, liturgically (high church/low church/broad church, etc.).  How would you envision fostering a sense of unity and belonging across the diocese?</b></font><br><br>
<p>The variety of expressions of the Episcopal Church in Northern Illinois are threads that strengthen the fabric of its ministry and corporate life.  When woven together by a faith grounded in the Gospel, mature leadership, and a shared vision, I believe the diversity of the diocese can be celebrated at a common table.</p>

<p>As we enter the 21st century, we are not called to just passively "live with" that diversity, but to embrace it creatively.  To do so, the people of the Diocese of Chicago must shape a shared vision of its future --- one that takes seriously what Jesus took seriously and is discerned through a process of study, reflection and prayer.  Nurturing the multi-dimensional diversity of this diocese will call for a "temenos" --- a safe, sacred space --- that welcomes inquiry and dialogue, encourages a free flow of beliefs and ideas, and gives everyone a voice, but not a veto.  Through such a process the people of the Diocese can birth a freedom of expression that cultivates the potential for healthy growth, expanded mission, and the optimal well-being of the Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>Since the earliest days of the Christian community, its diversity has been a strength to be built upon, not something to be feared and avoided.  In his letter to the Christian community in Rome, St. Paul wrote, "For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another." (Romans 12:4-5, NRSV)  Fostering the sense of unity and belonging in a community as diverse as the Diocese of Chicago will require the reaffirmation of the roots of our faith --- where the table was open to all in the name of Jesus and a loving God.</p>
