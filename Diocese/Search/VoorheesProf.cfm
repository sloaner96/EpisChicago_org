<p>In his nine years at St. Mark's, Toledo, Fr. Voorhees has broadened the membership and led the inner-city congregation into a strong program of community outreach. Numbering just 40 families when Voorhees arrived in 1989, the congregation has since tripled in size and welcomed over 30 community groups to share its space. With funding from government, church and private grants, St. Mark's has established 13 apartments for housing the homeless, created ministries for persons living with HIV/AIDS, and built companion relationships with Anglican churches in Kenya and with a school in Bethlehem on the West Bank.</p>

<p>Fr. Voorhees has a strong interest in biblical scholarship and congregational development.  He is a leader of "Living the Questions: A Study of the Records of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels," an annual symposium at the Kirkridge Conference Center, Pennsylvania; associate editor of Bible Workbench; a consultant to congregations in conflict and transition; and a facilitator for parish leadership development. His continuing education work includes studies at the Kirkridge Conference Center with Loren Mead on the church in the new millennium; at the Cape Cod Institute on organizational transformation; and at Kirkridge with John Dominic Crossan on the historical Jesus.</p>

<p>In the Diocese of Ohio he serves on the Professional Education Committee, and the Congregational Development Committee. He previously served on the Diocesan Council, the Advisory Committee for Metropolitan Congregations, and the Disability Outreach Network. His community activities include memberships on Toledo Metropolitan Mission and the Toledo Ecumenical Area Ministries.</p>

<p>Before his call to St. Mark's, Fr. Voorhees served six years as vicar, and later rector, at St. John's in Wake Forest, N.C. His two other cures were as rector of All Saints-Sharon Chapel in Alexandria, Va. (1978-1983); and assistant at St. Francis in Greenborough, N.C. (1975-1978).</p>

<p>Before entering seminary, Fr. Voorhees served on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.</p>
