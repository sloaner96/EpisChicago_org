<b><li>How would you encourage/nourish the participation of children and young adults in the church?</b></font><br><br>
<p>As a child in a Himalayan boarding school, I took Christianity seriously because mentors made the nature of discipleship clear to me from an early age.  As a drifting adolescent, I took Christ seriously again when I was asked to evaluate religious education at the school and when I was offered a spiritual retreat that brought Christianity together with Indian liturgical traditions.  Thus I know that young hearts can hear and respond when Christ is authentically shared.</p>

<p>By inviting young people to share leadership in Sunday worship we invite them into the heart of our life as Anglicans experiencing Christ. Forums with empathetic leaders give adolescents the chance to explore their emotional, intellectual and spiritual dilemmas in community. The St. Peter's Vestry has a teen-age member, and in Advent and Lent children and youth make eucharistic visits with me to the elderly. Leading trips to Appalachia and Zimbabwe has convinced me that mission can transform young people through the experiences of serving people and meeting Christ in other cultural settings.</p>

<p>Through such approaches I would encourage parishes to take young people seriously as pilgrim Christians.  Spending time during parish visitations with children and young adults would enlighten me and raise their profile in the congregations.  Youth would be invited into visible roles in the liturgies and councils of the diocese.  A special initiative would explore the needs and gifts of young adults, whether in college or in their early working life.  Retreats, leadership training, summer camp, and outreach ventures are all ways in which the diocese, with appropriate staff, could catalyze ministry with young people throughout northern Illinois.</p>

<p>A child is a gift in a family.  The family of the Church needs to nurture that gift for the young person's sake, for the world's sake, for God's sake.</p>

<b><li>What risks have you taken for the Gospel?</b></font><br><br>
<p>The gospel is the story of God risking in love for me and for the whole human family.  Risks I've taken, then, are small ways in which I may have participated in God's risky lifestyle!</p>

<p>Going to Zimbabwe with four young children shortly after that country's independence felt risky.  White rule had just ended, and we were whites seeking to help in reconciliation through the Church.  Violence was simmering between the Shona and Ndebele ethnic groups.  There were also the risks of disease, cultural isolation, and simply "dropping out of sight."  In Africa I re-learned the gospel through the faith and vitality of African Christians, and they enriched my spirituality and ministry.  Cross-cultural experience deeply nourished our children's faith.  The risk was more than worth it, and I gained my life.</p>

<p>Having offered suburban and international ministry, I felt called to spend my 40s in city work.  St. Peter's is located in the toughest part of Cambridge, and there had been talk of it merging or closing after a long decline since World War II.  Our children burst into tears over pizza after we showed them the church and the neighborhood.  Jane and I felt called to partnership in ministry, and that felt risky for our marriage!  Well, the parish is flourishing, our children wouldn't trade Central Square for anywhere else, and the four years Jane and I worked together helped us grow in both ministry and marriage.</p>

<p>Now, offering myself to Chicago feels risky.  I rejoice in the gifts of my experience, yet I know such a ministry will challenge me to grow beyond what I've done before.  If this is indeed my call, I know that very near will be God, "whose power working in us can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine."</p>

<b><li>As you know, the Diocese of Chicago moved from an assessment giving to voluntary giving.  Tell us about how your theology of stewardship might have an impact in the Diocese of Chicago.</b></font><br><br>
<p>God's action in the universe is a joyful and exultant movement of self-giving, whether in creation, in Christ's reconciling life, or in the pouring out of the Spirit.  Why is God like that?  God longs for community with us and will go to any lengths to nourish it.  God invites us to share in the movement of what God is up to in the world, and to use for that mission the gifts of life, relationship, and resources we have received.</p>

<p>This is the perspective I have sought to convey in the Massachusetts Stewardship Statement and as diocesan Stewardship Chair.  Its emphases on spirituality rather than duty, on God's mission rather than institutional maintenance, call for small-group work that evokes assessment and commitment through prayer, scripture and candid discussion.</p>

<p>Chicago's voluntary giving plan is risky, but it offers the diocese an opportunity to 'walk the talk' of stewardship being our joyful response to God's joy working in the world.  It invites the bishop to offer a compelling vision for what the diocese can be and do both for the parishes and on the frontier between the Church and the world.  The bishop must teach effectively a theology for giving that is regular, proportional and sacrificial.  As a catalyzing leader, the bishop beckons from the front, energizes from the middle, and then supports from the rear as people pass by and get on with their ministry.</p>

<p>Your five-year mission plan strikes crucial notes of self-support and new congregational development.  The diocese must also avoid a survival-of-the-fittest syndrome that could reduce the Church's congregational solidarity with the poor.  God's mission must be preached as a movement that draws us as stewards beyond ourselves to minister with communities different from our own in Christ's Body.</p>

<font face="Tahoma" color=navy size="-1">
<b><li>The Diocese of Chicago, as you may have gathered, is a diverse place in many ways: geographically, socioeconomically, ethnically, liturgically (high church/low church/broad church, etc.).  How would you envision fostering a sense of unity and belonging across the diocese?</b></font><br><br>
<p>The diversity of the diocese prompts me to tap into the diversity of my own experience as a resource for being with "all sorts and conditions" of people: Midwestern family roots alongside my New England life.  Factory labor in Chicago, farm work in Ohio, and newsgathering in Massachusetts before I became a priest.  Periods in Asia and Africa, where I lived as a minority person in stimulating cultures.  Rural, suburban and urban ministry that includes wide ethnic, economic and liturgical diversities.</p>

<p>This background has nourished my deep conviction that embracing diversity is part of God's salvation for us as persons, as a society, and as the Church.  Whatever enclave each of us inhabits, God has gifted us there, but we can't know the fullness of God from that perspective alone.  We need the breadth of the human family to help us grow into full humanity and into the Kingdom of God.  Truly, as the Anglican Max Warren put it, "It takes the whole world to know the whole gospel."</p>

<p>A bishop is called to be a symbol of the Church's unity and pastorally to nourish that unity.  Ironically, the call is realized substantially through the bishop celebrating the full diversity of God's people.  In your diocese, a great world center of diversity in both glory and struggle, a bishop needs to hear deeply the joys and pains of particular groups and to bring together people who have difficulty understanding and affirming one another.  The public life of the diocese, liturgical and deliberative, needs to embody the wide range of the diocese's people as we grow into Christ, who is our unity.  As the Church embraces the fullness of the human family, it can become a mustardseed  -- a model and catalyst -- of reconciliation and healing for American society as a whole.</p>
