<p>Dean Barlowe spent his first eight years as priest in the Diocese of New Jersey serving as assistant and later associate rector of St. Paul's, Westfield from 1983 to 1986; and then as rector of Grace Church, Plainfield from 1986 to 1991. As rector of Grace Church he encouraged the ministry of lay persons and deacons, welcomed the participation of female priests, and supported innovative Christian education and outreach programs, including an after-school program for latch-key children. During his rectorate, a membership decline was reversed, and member giving and attendance increased substantially.</p>

<p>He was called to St. Paul's Church in Des Moines, Iowa in 1991 to lead the congregation into its new ministry as the cathedral of the Diocese of Iowa. After two years as rector, he was installed as dean of the new cathedral by Bishop Christopher Epting. Since coming to St. Paul's he has emphasized the cathedral's role as a spiritual resource for the diocese, and as a center for outreach and the arts in Des Moines.  His efforts include founding a music academy, creating a Center for Christian Spirituality, designing a "cathedral curriculum" for adults, creating a network of small groups meeting at parishioners' homes for mutual support and encouragement, and opening the liturgy to greater lay participation.</p>

<p>His ministry at the diocesan level in Iowa has included terms as secretary and vice president of the Diocesan Council, and as member of the Commission on Ministry and the New Church Starts Committee. He also was founding president of the Iowa Episcopal Clergy Association.  He is currently president of the Des Moines Child Guidance Center, vice president of the Orchard Place Youth and Family Services, and a member of the Ethics Committee for the University of Osteopathic Medicine. In New Jersey, he served on the Christian Education Committee, Urban Work Committee, and Youth Commission; and chaired the Long-Range Planning Committee and the Training and Selection Committee for the Vocational Diaconate.</p>

<p>Dean Barlowe has served as deputy to three General Conventions (1991, 1994 and 1997); as a field education supervisor at General Theological Seminary; and as consultant to the Standing Committee on Ecumenical Relations.</p>

<p>Before entering seminary, Dean Barlowe was employed as a corporate lending officer at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
