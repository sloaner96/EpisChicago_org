<p>The seal of the Diocese of Chicago was designed by Ralph Adams Cram and adopted by Diocesan Convention in 1904. The three crosslets on the red field represent the three Illinois dioceses (Chicago, Springfield, and Quincy). The three gold fleur de lis on the blue inverted Y represent the French explorers, the first Europeans to visit Illinois.</p>

<p>As a symbol of Chicago's recovery from the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, a red phoenix rises from flames on a small white shield, a symbol also used by the University of Chicago. The seal's inscription-SIGUILLUM DIOCESES CHICAGOENSIS A.D. 1835, FIDE PARTA FIDE AUCTA-includes a Latin motto authored by Illinois's second bishop, Henry J. Whitehouse (1852-1874), which translates: "Conceived in faith, by faith achieved." The lappets of the mitre bear the motto of Philander Chase, the first bishop of Illinois (1835-1852). It reads Jehovah jireh, which translates "The Lord will provide."

<p>The most visible representation of the seal is on the bishop's chair in St. James Cathedral. This handpainted wood carving is also the model for the web site seal graphic.</p>
