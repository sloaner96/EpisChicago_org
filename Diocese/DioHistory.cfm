<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">
<p>The Episcopal Diocese of Chicago traces its beginning to 1835 when Bishop Philander Chase founded the Diocese of Illinois. In 1877 two new dioceses were created out of the western portion of the state (the Diocese of Quincy) and the central and southern sections (the Diocese of Springfield) leaving the northern third of Illinois to the original diocese which took the name of its see city, Chicago. With 43,000 baptized members, 380 clergy and 137 congregations, the Diocese of Chicago ranks as the twelfth largest of the 100 domestic dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States. It comprises 21 counties and 12,000 square miles, bounded on the west by the Mississippi River, on the north by the Wisconsin border, on the east by Lake Michigan, and on the south by Interstate 74. Besides Chicago, its principal cities include Aurora, DeKalb, Elgin, Joliet, Kankakee, Rockford, and Waukegan. Diocesan headquarters are located adjacent to St. James Cathedral at Rush and Huron Streets in Chicago. St. James Cathedral, founded in 1834, was the first Episcopal Church in northern Illinois and was designated the diocesan cathedral in 1955, succeeding the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul which was destroyed by fire in 1921.</p>
<p>Spiritual oversight of the diocese is vested in its bishop, the Rt. Rev. William D. Persell, who was elected the 11th bishop of Chicago Nov. 14, 1998, and consecrated bishop March 13, 1999. Bishop Persell succeeds Bishop Frank Griswold who was elected the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 1997. Bishop Persell is assisted by the Rt. Rev. Victor Scantlebury who was appointed assistant bishop of Chicago in February 2000.</p>
<p>The bishop serves as presiding officer of the administrative bodies of the diocese, including the Diocesan Council (budget and program), Bishop and Trustees (property management and gifts and endowments) and Diocesan Convention (legislation); and as the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese. The bishop is assisted by a 25-member staff organized in five departments: Office of the Bishop; Church Center Operations; Finance and Administration; Congregational Development; and Ministry Development. </p>
<p>Rooted in the church's Anglo-Catholic tradition, the Diocese of Chicago welcomes a diversity of cultural, liturgical and theological expression as exemplified in its worship settings which range from evangelical to traditional Anglo-Catholic; in its ethnic diversity (seven Hispanic congregations, ten African American congregations and a joint Anglo-Korean congregation) and in its affiliated organizations which include the Brotherhood of St. Andrew (service),  Cursillo (faith renewal), Episcopal Church Women (service), Episcopal Council for Global Mission, Episcopal Peace Fellowship, Episcopalians United for Renewal and Reform, Integrity (gay/lesbian caucus), the Society of St. Mary (Marian devotional), and the Union of Black Episcopalians.</p>
<p>The diocese's commitment to social witness and community service is expressed through the work of 13 Episcopal Charities and Community Service agencies; various committees including the Hunger Commission, AIDS Task Force, Committee on Affordable Housing; the Committee on Ending Racism, and the Commission on Aging; and participation in community organizing efforts such as United Power for Action and Justice, and JACOB (Joliet Area Church based Organizing Body). Most diocesan congregations are engaged in some form of outreach, many through diocesan or ecumenical partnerships such as the PADS (Public Action to Deliver Shelter) program; Habitat for Humanity; and various transitional and long-term housing ministries.</p>

<P>The diocese's ethnic diversity is reflected in its seven Hispanic congregations, 12 African-Amercan and West Indian congregations, and one Anglo-Korean congregation. Of the seven Hispanic congregations, four are missions while the remaining three are noncanonical congregations in mutual ministry or space-sharing partnerships with Anglo congregations. Three are located in Chicago and the others are in Blue Island, Elgin, Franklin Park and Waukegan.</P>
<P>The 12 African American congregations are in Chicago, Evanston, Harvey, and Maywood; and are split evenly between parishes and missions. The diocese's Korean members attend One in Christ Episcopal Church, Park Ridge, a joint Anglo-Korean mission under the leadership of a Korean priest.</P>
