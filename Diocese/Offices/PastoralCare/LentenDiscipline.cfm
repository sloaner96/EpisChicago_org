by The Rev. Randall R. Warren, D.Min.<br><br>

<p>The season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday on March 8, 2000. The choice of a discipline by which to keep the liturgical season of Lent is, perhaps more than any other of our spiritual practices, problematic for many Christians. Lent often leads to regression rather than growth. Many of us choose to ignore Lent. Others of us dismiss it by giving up chocolate or by performing some other equally shallow observance. Nevertheless the point of any liturgical season and any spiritual practice is that we grow and be healthy. It should therefore be possible to choose a lenten discipline which is a positive activity which calls us into the depths of our being.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>In the earliest centuries of the Church, people kept a fast of two or three days prior to Easter. It is in the canons of the Council of Nicaea (325 AD, Canon 5) that we first find mention of a forty-day period. This fast entailed abstinence from meat, fish, eggs and dairy products while limiting the faithful to one meal a day usually taken towards evening. For many centuries, the choice of a lenten discipline was a communal activity, not an individual one. By the 15th century, it was customary also to take a meal at noon. Similarly, eating fish was allowed throughout the Middle Ages and abstinence from dairy products was all but forgotten. </p>
<p>By the 19th century, the Church began to stress fasting less while emphasizing almsgiving and performing additional religious exercises. Over the years since the early stages of the Oxford Movement reinvigorated the practice of keeping Lent and consonant with the rise of individualism in America and Europe, the choice of a lenten discipline has become an individual rather than a communal activity. While we may choose to revitalize our practice of communal preparations for Easter, it is nonetheless important for us to see the psychological and spiritual value of individual lenten disciplines. </p>

<h4>Social conditioning has distorted purpose of Lent</h4>
<p>Modern Americans are raised in a spiritually toxic environment. Often divorced from a lively participation in nature, we grow up in a mechanical and materialistic milieu. Many of us were raised by parents who are deeply wounded by society. Parents of color suffer under the effects of racism. Our mothers, grandmothers and sisters have been scared by sexism and our fathers by the heavy demands of male social priority. We all know of a mother or grandmother who copes with chronic low self-esteem. We all know of a father or grandfather who was clinically depressed by his inability to provide for his family during that aptly named period of economic chaos; the depression. Wounded parents often do the best they can to raise healthy children only to have other social pressures intervene. We frequently see children undergo a dramatic weight loss or gain as they enter that high-pressure social crucible called high school. We worry about drugs, smoking, sexually transmitted diseases, and job availability not to mention gangs, violence, and drunk drivers. It is all to easy to grow up feeling profoundly flawed, unlovable, or merely unsafe, despite the fact that there is much in our world and our society which is good and beautiful. It is easy to be angry that we, our parents or our world are not somehow more, better or different. Out of fear of reprisal, or in hope of survival, we suppress these feelings or cover them with a thin veneer of bravado and aggression.</p>
<p>Suppressed feelings do not stay hidden for very long. Soon these feelings begin to express themselves in destructive ways. Addictions, depression, low self-esteem, extra-marital affairs or any number of problems arise and force us to see the feelings we do not want to feel. Fortunately, by the grace of God and with the love and support of friends, we can begin to realize that flaws and all we are lovable. As we improve in spiritual health, we begin to claim our worth and lovability before God. We assert ourselves appropriately, seek healthy relationships and strive to practice moral behavior. We stop hoping to survive and start working for life. We begin to agree with St. Irenaeus that "The glory of God is humanity fully alive."</p>
<p>And then along comes Lent. Those around us in church start declaring how evil, mean, nasty, wrong, and totally unworthy they are. Low self-esteem is paraded as humility. People start talking about sin in a way that is self-denigrating and abasing. Now, of course, Episcopalians never really abase themselves, but the language is there, and that language sounds very much like the shrill  voice of narcissistic condemnation which we have worked so hard to exorcize from our lives. The fear of hearing that voice within our own hearts and minds or the reality of not having exorcized it in the first place motivates us to either ignore or dismiss Lent.</p>
<p>Lent, however, means "springtime" and the humility which we talk about during Lent has as its deepest meaning, "grounded" or "of the earth." This suggests a profound honesty about who we are. Even the word "sin" when used to describe a state of being is less about reprehensibility and more about estrangement from God. Lent is not about abusing or denigrating ourselves, it is about setting aside time to practice self-honesty in either reflection or action. While a patriarchal and fundamentalist understanding of Lent would have us wallow in feelings of unworthiness, we can see that those very feelings keep us estranged from God and each other. We can choose lenten disciplines which enable us to get in touch with our true selves. </p>
<p>Self-honesty is never easy. Setting aside time for meditation during which we really have to be alone with ourselves can be rather frightening. It can also be quite a challenge to keep a journal, read spiritual books, volunteer at a shelter or soup kitchen, enter psychotherapy or begin spiritual direction. Even so, reflecting on such activities can teach us something about who we are and what God is calling us to do and to be. Simply denying, giving up or abasing ourselves is not healthy and usually just makes us grumpy. But really reflecting on our lives and our feelings (and then talking about them with a trusted friend or a discreet and understanding priest) is a challenge that can open us to the joy of the resurrection. Honestly thinking about the abundance of God's love for us can lead us to ask a socially active acquaintance or a deacon to show us where we might serve. Such service deepens our compassion and increases our thankfulness. Indeed, anything which promotes growth and healthiness makes for a good lenten discipline, especially if it is done with mindfulness and time for reflection.</p>


<h4>Some things to Think about When Choosing a Lenten Observance for Yourself</h4>

<ol>
<p><li>If you are going to give up something for Lent, choose something you want to give up permanently, like smoking, drinking, unhealthy foods, etc., and then use Lent as a way to get started.  Remember that the idea of a fast is to use your craving for the thing you have given up as a call to prayer.</p>
<p><li>If you are going to take on an additional activity for Lent, think about your life and choose something which fits who you are and yet also challenges you to grow.  For example, if you are an extremely outgoing and active person, you might choose to put some of your energy into a social service or evangelism project.  This would be better than deciding to meditate for an hour each day because, given your personality type, you would probably be unable to keep this observance for the entire season of Lent.  Remember, you want to grow, not set yourself up for failure.</p>
<p><li>If you are going to take on an additional activity for Lent, choose something which you want to make a permanent part of your life and use Lent as a way to get started.  Exercise programs, psychotherapy and spiritual direction are good examples.</p>
