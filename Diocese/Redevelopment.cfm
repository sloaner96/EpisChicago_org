<p>Plans for redeveloping the Episcopal Church Center in the Diocese of Chicago remain on track in the wake of securing approval by Chicago's key regulatory bodies. At its Novembe2004 meeting the Chicago Plan Commission approved plans from LR Development, the project developer, for a 63-story office and residential tower that will replace the current five-story diocesan and cathedral office building at Rush and Huron Streets on the city's Near North Side. A second critical vote came Dec. 16 when the City Council's Zoning Committee unanimously approved the project, followed the next day by the City Council's endorsement.</p>
<p>The city's backing is welcome news given the hard work by diocesan staff, the diocese's development team and its consultants over the past two and a half years, said Bishop William Persell. "It is exciting but also hard to believe that we have taken this major step forward," he said. "The building's design will be notable on the skyline of our great city, known for its architecture, and the new diocesan and cathedral center, and the proceeds from the property lease will greatly enhance our mission."</p>
<p>The preservation of a portion of the existing plaza was a key factor in winning support from Alderman Burton Nartarus whose 42nd ward includes the Cathedral District that borders North Michigan Avenue. During the Zoning Committee discussion Natarus praised the architects for the aesthetics of their design and efforts to retain a public plaza, noting the building will be a likely candidate for an American Institute of Architects award.</p>
<p>Construction could begin as early as spring 2005. The diocese and LR Development currently have an agreement to enter into a ground lease for a 120-year term. A lease will be signed once all permits and financing are in place.</p>
<p>The new building will replace a five-story Mies van der Rhoe style office building constructed in 1967 and which increasingly requires costly repairs and upgrades to its elevator and heating and ventilation system and to meet public safety code requirements. </p>
