		<p>Our witness in Northern Illinois is thriving in small towns and rural settings as well as in urban areas. In the Bible, agricultural imagery speaks to our calling to share the Good News of Christ and to the abundance of God's blessings.</p>

		<p>The geography of Northern Illinois is defined and joined by its network of rivers: the Chicago, Des Plaines, Fox, Kankakee, Kishwaukee and Rock. In our tradition water symbolizes new life, abundance and righteousness.</p>

		<p>The cross, the central symbol of our faith, is symbolized in the warp and weft threads anchoring two quadrants of the logo. This "unfinished" cross speaks to the church's mission which is to carry out Christ's reconciling work in the world.</p>
