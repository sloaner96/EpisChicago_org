<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">
<p>Welcome to this new expression of our identity and mission as the Episcopal Church in Northern Illinois.  Over the next few months you will be seeing more of it in other formats and functions. What has happened? Simply put we are following Christ's example and putting new wine into new wineskins.</p>
<p>This new wine is a refocused and reinvigorated sense of mission. This redirection is evident in our church planting efforts, our support for social justice, and our work in global ministry, to name just a few examples. We are answering God's call to reach not only those entering our doorways, and those passing by, but to those who have never heard of the Episcopal Church, or any church for that matter.</p>
<p>Our mission is set out in the Catechism in our Book of Common Prayer: ". . . to restore all people to unity with God and each other in Christ." And this is echoed in the new mission statement adopted at the Diocesan Convention last November:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="Maroon">As the Anglican community in Northern Illinois, called by God to new and abundant life in Christ, we celebrate and share our Christian faith and tradition through worship, study, fellowship, social witness and service.</font></p></blockquote>
